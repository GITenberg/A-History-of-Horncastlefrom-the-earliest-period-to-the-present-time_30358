<h2><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following pages may truthfully be said to be the result of
labours, extending over many years, and of researches in
directions too many to tell.</p>
<p>Born within almost a mile of Horncastle, and only by a few
months escaping being born in it, since his father, on first
coming to the neighbourhood, resided for a time in Horncastle, <a
name="citation0"></a><a href="#footnote0"
class="citation">[0]</a> the author, from his earliest years
(except for periodical absences) has been connected with the
life, social or civil, of the place, probably more closely and
more continuously, than any other person living, in like
circumstances.</p>
<p>The notes on which this compilation is based were begun more
than 30 years ago.&nbsp; While writing a volume of <i>Records of
more than</i> 30 <i>Parishes around Horncastle</i>, published in
1904; and, before that, while describing about as many more, in a
volume, <i>Woodhall Spa and Neighbourhood</i>, published in 1899,
he had constantly in view the crowning of the series, by the
history of the old town, round which these sixty, or more,
parishes cluster; the haunt, if not quite the home, of his
boyhood, and familiarized to him by a life-long connection.</p>
<p>For this purpose sources of information have been tapped in
every possible direction; of public institutions, the official
records, and title deeds, where available, have been carefully
consulted; especially should be here mentioned various deeds and
charters, which are quoted in Chapter II, from the archives of
Carlisle Cathedral, which have not hitherto been brought before
the public, but of which the author has been allowed free use,
through the courtesy of the librarian.&nbsp; These are of special
value, from the long connection of the Manor of Horncastle with
the See of Carlisle.</p>
<p>In other cases the author has been allowed the privilege of
more private testimony; for instance, his old friend, the late
Mr. John Overton (of a highly <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>respectable family, for generations connected with the
town and county), has most kindly given him the use of various
family MS. notes, bearing on parish and other matters.&nbsp; Mr.
Henry Sharp has freely assisted him with most varied information,
derived from long years of connection with the town, in public or
private capacity.&nbsp; The late Mr. Henry Boulton, ancestrally
connected with various parts of the county, was remarkable for a
mind stored with memories of persons and things, in town and
neighbourhood, which he freely communicated to the author, who
saw much of him in his later years.&nbsp; While, last but not
least, the late Mr. William Pacey, whether in his
&ldquo;Reminisences of Horncastle,&rdquo; which he contributed to
the public newspapers, or in his personal conversations, which
the present writer enjoyed for many years, yielded up to him
treasure, collected by an indefatigable student of local lore,
who entered into such work <i>con amore</i>.</p>
<p>To all these the author would now fully, and gratefully,
acknowledge his indebtedness; but for them this work could not
have been produced in anything like its present fulness.&nbsp; In
some of the matters dealt with, as for instance in the accounts
of the Grammar School, as well as in other portions, he may
fairly say, in the language of &ldquo;the pious
&AElig;neas&rdquo; (slightly modified), &ldquo;quorum pars (ipse)
fui,&rdquo; (&AElig;neid ii, 6); and in these he has drawn not a
few of the details from his own recollections.</p>
<p>In stringing these records together, of such varied character,
and on subjects so numerous, he cannot but be conscious that, in
the endeavour to give all possible information, and to omit
nothing of real interest, he may, on the other hand, have laid
himself open to the charge of being too diffuse, or even
needlessly prolix.&nbsp; Others not sharing his own interest in
the subjects treated of, may think that he has occasionally
&ldquo;ridden his hobby too hard.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this should be
the judgment of any of his readers, he would crave their
indulgence out of consideration for the motive.</p>
<p>These are the days of historic &ldquo;Pageants,&rdquo; drawn
from life, and with living actors to illustrate them.&nbsp; We
have also our &ldquo;Gossoping Guides,&rdquo; to enable the
tourist to realize more fully the meaning of the scenes which he
visits.&nbsp; From both of these the author &ldquo;has taken his
cue.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had to cater for a variety of tastes; and
while, for the general reader he has cast his discriptions in a
colloquial, or even at times in a &ldquo;gossoping,&rdquo; form,
he believes that the old town, with its &ldquo;Bull Ring,&rdquo;
its &ldquo;Maypole Hill,&rdquo; its &ldquo;Fighting Cocks,&rdquo;
its &ldquo;Julian Bower,&rdquo; and other old time memories, can
still afford <i>pabulum</i> for the more educated student, or the
special antiquary.</p>
<p>Like the composer of a Pageant play, his endeavour has been
rather to clothe the scenes, which he conjures up, with the flesh
and blood of quickened reality, than in the bare skin and bones
of a dry-as-dust&rsquo;s rigid skeleton.&nbsp; How far he has
succeeded in this he leaves to others to decide; for himself he
can honestly say, that it has not been from lack of care,
enquiry, or labour, if he has fallen short of the ideal aimed
at.</p>

1</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>PART I&mdash;PREHISTORIC.&nbsp; HORNCASTLE&mdash;ITS
INFANCY.</h3>
<p>In dealing with what may be called &ldquo;the dark ages&rdquo;
of local history, we are often compelled to be content with
little more than reasonable conjecture.&nbsp; Still, there are
generally certain surviving data, in place-names, natural
features, and so forth, which enable those who can detect them,
and make use of them, to piece together something like a
connected outline of what we may take, with some degree of
probability, as an approximation to what have been actual facts,
although lacking, at the time, the chronicler to record them.</p>
<p>It is, however, by no means a mere exercise of the
imagination, if we assume that the site of the present Horncastle
was at a distant period a British settlement. <a
name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a"
class="citation">[1a]</a>&nbsp; Dr. Brewer says, &ldquo;nearly
three-fourths of our Roman towns were built on British
sites,&rdquo; (Introduction to <i>Beauties of England</i>, p. 7),
and in the case of Horncastle, although there is nothing British
in the name of the town itself, yet that people have undoubtedly
here left their traces behind them.&nbsp; The late Dr. Isaac
Taylor <a name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b"
class="citation">[1b]</a> says, &ldquo;Rivers and mountains, as a
rule, receive their names from the earliest races, towns and
villages from later colonists.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ideas of those
early occupants were necessarily limited.&nbsp; The hill which
formed their stronghold against enemies, <a
name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c"
class="citation">[1c]</a> or which was the &ldquo;high
place&rdquo; of their religious rites, <a
name="citation1d"></a><a href="#footnote1d"
class="citation">[1d]</a> and the river which was so essential to
their daily existence, of these they felt the value, and
therefore naturally distinguished <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>them by name
before anything else.&nbsp; Thus the remark of an eloquent writer
is generally true, who says &ldquo;our mountains and rivers still
murmur the voices of races long extirpated.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is hardly (says Dr. Taylor <a
name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a"
class="citation">[2a]</a>) throughout the whole of England a
river name which is not Celtic,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> British.</p>
<p>As the Briton here looked from the hill-side, down upon the
valley beneath him, two of the chief objects to catch his eye
would be the streams which watered it, and which there, as they
do still, united their forces.&nbsp; They would then also,
probably, form a larger feature in the prospect than they do at
the present day, for the local beds of gravel deposit would seem
to indicate that these streams were formerly of considerably
greater volume, watering a wider area, and probably having
ramifications which formed shoals and islands. <a
name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b"
class="citation">[2b]</a>&nbsp; The particular names by which the
Briton designated the two main streams confirm this
supposition.&nbsp; In the one coming from the more distant wolds,
he saw a stream bright and clear, meandering through the meadows
which it fertilized, and this he named the &ldquo;Bain,&rdquo; <a
name="citation2c"></a><a href="#footnote2c"
class="citation">[2c]</a> that word being Celtic for
&ldquo;bright&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear,&rdquo; a characteristic
which still belongs to its waters, as the brewers of Horncastle
assure us.&nbsp; In the other stream, which runs a shorter and
more rapid course, he saw a more turbid current, and to it he
gave the name &ldquo;Waring,&rdquo; <a name="citation2d"></a><a
href="#footnote2d" class="citation">[2d]</a> which is the Celtic
&ldquo;garw&rdquo; or &ldquo;gerwin,&rdquo; meaning
&ldquo;rough.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each of these names, then, we may
regard as what the poet Horace calls &ldquo;nomen pr&aelig;sente
not&acirc; productum,&rdquo; <a name="citation2e"></a><a
href="#footnote2e" class="citation">[2e]</a> they are as good as
coin stamped in the mint of a Cunobelin, or a Caradoc, bearing
his &ldquo;image and superscription,&rdquo; and after some 17
centuries of change, they are in circulation still.&nbsp; So long
as Horncastle is watered by the Bain and the Waring she will bear
the brand of the British sway, once paramount in her valley.</p>
<p>These river names, however, are not the only relics of the
Britons found in Horncastle.&nbsp; Two British urns were
unearthed about 50 years ago, where is now the garden of the
present vicarage, and another was found in the parish of
Thornton, about a mile from the town, when the railway was being
made in 1856.&nbsp; The latter the present writer has seen,
although it is now unfortunately lost. <a
name="citation2f"></a><a href="#footnote2f"
class="citation">[2f]</a></p>
<p>These Britons were a pastoral race, as C&aelig;sar, their
conqueror, tells us, <a name="citation2g"></a><a
href="#footnote2g" class="citation">[2g]</a> not cultivating much
corn, but having large flocks and herds, living on the milk and
flesh of their live stock, and clad in the skins of these, or of
other animals taken in the chase.&nbsp; The well-watered pastures
of the Bain valley would afford excellent grazing for their
cattle, while the extensive forests <a name="citation2h"></a><a
href="#footnote2h" class="citation">[2h]</a> of <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the district
around would provide them with the recreations of the chase,
which also helped to make them the skilled warriors which the
Romans found them to be. <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; Much of these
forests remained even down to comparatively recent times, and
very large trees have been dug up, black with age, in fields
within four or five miles of Horncastle, within very recent
years, which the present writer has seen.</p>
<p>Such were some of the earlier inhabitants of this locality,
leaving their undoubted traces behind them, but no &ldquo;local
habitation&rdquo; with a name; for that we are first indebted to
the Romans, who, after finding the Briton a foe not unworthy of
his steel, ultimately subjugated him and found him not an inapt
pupil in Roman arts and civilization.&nbsp; Of the aptitude of
the Briton to learn from his conquerors we have evidence in the
fact, mentioned by the Roman writer Eumenius, that when the
Emperor Constantius wished to rebuild the town Augustodunum (now
Antun) in Gaul, about the end of the 3rd century, he employed
workmen chiefly from Britain, such was the change effected in our
&ldquo;rude forefathers&rdquo; in 250 years.</p>
<p>We may sum up our remarks on the Britons by saying that in
them we have ancestors of whom we have no occasion to be
ashamed.&nbsp; They had a Christian church more than 300 years
before St. Augustine visited our shores.&nbsp; They yet survive
in the sturdy fisher folk of Brittany; in those stout miners of
Cornwall, who in the famed Botallack mine have bored under the
ocean bed, the name Cornwall itself being Welsh (<i>i.e.</i>
British) for corner land; in the people who occupy the fastnesses
of the Welsh mountains, as well as in the Gaels of the Scottish
Highlands and the Erse of Ireland.&nbsp; Their very speech is
blended with our own.&nbsp; Does the country labourer go to the
Horncastle tailor to buy coat and breeches?&nbsp; His British
forefather, though clad chiefly in skins, called his upper
garment his &ldquo;cotta,&rdquo; his nether covering his
&ldquo;brages,&rdquo; scotice &ldquo;breeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brewer,
<i>Introduction to Beauties of England</i>, p. 42.</p>
<h3>PART II&mdash;THE DIMLY HISTORIC PERIOD.</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Roman forces in our own part of
Britain were at York, where more than one Roman Emperor lived and
died, but Lindum, now Lincoln, was an important station.&nbsp;
About A.D. 71 Petillius Cerealis was appointed governor of the
province by the Emperor Vespasian, he was succeeded by Julius
Frontinus, both being able generals.&nbsp; From A.D. 78 to 85
that admirable soldier and administrator, Julius Agricola,
over-ran the whole <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of the north as far as the Grampians,
establishing forts in all directions, and doubtless during these
and the immediately succeeding years, a network of such stations
would be constructed in our own country, connected by those
splendid highways which the Romans carried, by the forced labour
of the natives, through the length and breadth of their vast
empire.</p>
<p>Coins of nearly all the Roman Emperors have been found at
Horncastle; one was brought to the present writer in the 1st year
of the 20th century, bearing the superscription of the Emperor
Severus, who died at York A.D., 211.</p>

<p>A Roman milestone was discovered in the Bail, at Lincoln, in
1891, <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> inscribed with the name of Marcus
Piavonius Victorinus, who commanded in Gaul and Britain, and
which must have been set up during his period of office, about A
D. 267.&nbsp; The site of this was the point of intersection of
the two main streets, which would be the centre of the Roman
Forum at Lindum, one of these streets leading to Horncastle; from
Horncastle also there branched off, as will be hereafter noted,
several main Roman roads.</p>
<p>As Horncastle stands on the banks of the river Bain it has
been taken by Stukeley, the antiquarian, and by others following
him, <a name="citation5b"></a><a href="#footnote5b"
class="citation">[5b]</a> to have been the Roman Banovallum or
&ldquo;Fort on the Bain,&rdquo; mentioned by the Roman geographer
of Ravenna; <a name="citation5c"></a><a href="#footnote5c"
class="citation">[5c]</a> although, however, most probably
correct, this is a mere conjecture.&nbsp; On the road between
Horncastle and Lincoln we have the village of Baumber, also
called Bamburgh, and this latter form of the name might well mean
a &ldquo;burgh,&rdquo; or fort, on the Bain, the river running
just below the village.&nbsp; The two names, however, might well
exist at different periods.&nbsp; It may be here mentioned that
this form, Bamburg, is found in <i>Harleian Charter</i> 56, c. i,
B.M., dated at Wodehalle, December, 1328.</p>
<p>Tacitus, the Roman historian, <a name="citation5e"></a><a
href="#footnote5e" class="citation">[5e]</a> tells us that the
Romans &ldquo;wore out the bodies and hands of the Britons in
opening out the forests, and paving or fortifying the
roads,&rdquo; and we can well imagine that those skilled generals
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>would see the advantageous position for a stronghold in
the angle formed by the junction of the two rivers, and would
employ the subjugated Britons of the locality in constructing, it
may be, at first only a rude fort, protected on two sides by the
streams and in the rear by a &ldquo;vallum,&rdquo; or embankment,
and that on the site thus secured and already a native
stronghold, they would, at a later period, erect the
&ldquo;castrum,&rdquo; of which massive fragments still remain,
testifying to its great strength.</p>
<p>These remains, indeed, in almost their whole course can be
traced through present-day gardens and back premises, shewing the
four sides of an irregular parallelogram.&nbsp; Their dimensions,
roughly speaking, are on the north and south sides about 600-ft.,
by about 350-ft. at the eastern, and 300-ft. at the western end,
their thickness being about 16-ft.&nbsp; The material employed
was the Spilsby sandstone, obtainable within five miles, cemented
by course grouting poured into the interstices between the
massive blocks.&nbsp; These walls inclose a portion of the High
Street as far eastward as the site of the present Corn Exchange,
westward they include the present manor house and form the
boundary of the churchyard in that direction.&nbsp; On the north
they run at the back of the houses on that side of the Market
Place, and on the south they extend from St. Mary&rsquo;s Square,
past the Grammar School, and through sundry yards, parallel with
the branch of the canal, which is the old Waring river.&nbsp; The
masonry of these walls, as now seen, is very rude.&nbsp; It is
supposed that, originally as built by the Romans, they had an
external coating of neat structure, but this has entirely
disappeared, it is still, however, to be seen in the wells, which
are next to be described.</p>
<p>In a cellar, south of the High Street, at a baker&rsquo;s
shop, and close to the eastern wall of the castle, is a Roman
well; there is another close to the north-east angle of the
castle walls, in what is called Dog-kennel Yard, and a third just
within the western wall, near the present National Schools.&nbsp;
Thus, although the two rivers were without the castle walls, the
Roman garrison was well supplied with water.</p>
<p>The Roman roads branching from the town were (1st) the
&ldquo;Ramper,&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> as it is still
called, running north-west, and connecting it with the Roman
station Lindum; from this, at Baumber, <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a> distant about 4 miles, a branch running
northwards led to the Roman Castrum, now Caistor; (2nd)
north-eastwards <i>via</i> West Ashby, being the highway to
Louth, the Roman Luda; (3rd) eastwards, by High Toynton,
Greetham, &amp;c, to Waynflete, the Roman Vain-ona; (4th)
southward, by Dalderby, Haltham, &amp;c., to Leeds Gate, Chapel
Hill, and there crossing the river Witham to Sleaford and
Ancaster, the Roman Causenn&aelig;, situated on the great Roman
Ermin Street.&nbsp; This also was continued to another Roman
Castrum, now Castor, near Peterborough; (5th) south-west, by
Thornton, &amp;c., to Tattershall, locally supposed to have been
the Roman Durobriv&aelig;, and where traces of a Roman camp still
remain.</p>
<p>Besides these Roman <i>vi&aelig;</i> and Roman coins, quite an
abundance of Roman pottery has from time to time been unearthed,
and fragments are continually being found in gardens in the
town.&nbsp; A collection of these, probably cinerary urns, was
preserved until quite recently in the library of the
Mechanics&rsquo; <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Institute, where the writer has
frequently seen them, <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a> they varied in
height from 8 inches to 18 inches.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for lack
of funds, that institution was broken up about 1890, the books
were stowed away in a room at the workhouse, a valuable
collection, and the urns were sold by the late Mr. Joseph
Willson, who acted as sole trustee.&nbsp; Other Roman relics have
been fragments of mortars of white clay, found on the site of the
present union, one bearing the word &ldquo;fecit,&rdquo; though
the maker&rsquo;s name was lost.&nbsp; Portions also of Samian
ware have been found, one stamped with a leopard and stag,
another bearing part of the potter&rsquo;s name, <span
class="smcap">iliani</span>; with fragments of hand-mills,
fibul&aelig;, &amp;c. <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; The present
writer has two jars, or bottles, of buff coloured ware, of which
about a dozen were dug up when the foundations of the workhouse
were being laid in 1838, they are probably Samian, a friend
having exactly similar vessels which she brought from
Cyprus.&nbsp; The writer has in his possession the head of a
porphyritic mallet which was found in a garden in the south of
the town a few years ago, it is probably Roman; the handle, which
would be of wood, had entirely disappeared; it is much

<p>A discovery of further interesting Roman relics of another
kind was made in 1896.&nbsp; The owner of a garden near Queen
Street, in the south-eastern part of the town, was digging up an
apple tree when he came across a fine bed of gravel.&nbsp;
Continuing the digging, in order to find the thickness of this
deposit, his spade struck against a hard substance, which proved
to be a lead coffin.&nbsp; After this had been examined by others
invited to inspect it, without any satisfactory result, the
present writer was requested to conduct further
investigation.&nbsp; The coffin was found to be 5-ft. 2-in. in
length, containing the skeleton, rather shorter, of a
female.&nbsp; A few days later a second coffin was found, lying
parallel to the first, 5-ft. 7-in. in length, the bones of the
skeleton within being <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>larger and evidently those of a
male.&nbsp; Subsequently fragments of decayed wood and long iron
nails and clamps were found, showing that the leaden coffins had
originally been enclosed in wooden cases.&nbsp; Both these
coffins lay east and west.&nbsp; A description was sent to a
well-known antiquarian, the late Mr. John Bellows of Gloucester,
and he stated that if the lead had an admixture of tin they were
Roman, if no tin, post-Roman.&nbsp; The lead was afterwards
analysed by Professor Church, of Kew, and by the analytical
chemist of Messrs. Kynoch &amp; Co., of Birmingham, with the
result that there was found to be a percentage of 1.65 of tin to
97.08 of lead and 1.3 of oxygen, &ldquo;the metal slightly
oxidised.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was thus proved that the coffins were
those of Romans, their &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; implying that
they were Christian.&nbsp; It should be added that three similar
coffins were found in the year 1872, when the foundations were
being laid of the New Jerusalem Chapel in Croft Street, within
some 100 yards of the two already described; and further, as
confirmatory of their being Roman, a lead coffin was also found
in the churchyard of Baumber, on the restoration of the church
there in 1892, this being close to the Roman road (already
mentioned) between the old Roman stations Banovallum and
Lindum.&nbsp; Lead coffins have also been found in the Roman
cemeteries at Colchester, York, and at other places. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>As another interesting case of Roman relics found in
Horncastle, I give the following:&mdash;In 1894 I exhibited, at a
meeting of our Arch&aelig;ological Society, some small clay pipes
which had recently been dug up along with a copper coin of the
Emperor Constantine, just within the western wall of the old
castle, near the present Manor House.&nbsp; They were evidently
very old and of peculiar make, being short in stem with small
bowl set at an obtuse angle.&nbsp; They were said at the time to
be Roman, but since tobacco was not introduced till the reign of
Elizabeth that idea was rejected.&nbsp; In the year 1904,
however, a large quantity of fragments of similar clay pipes were
found in the ruins of the Roman fort of Aliso, near Halteren on
the river Lippe, in Western Germany, some of rude structure, some
decorated with figures and Roman characters.&nbsp; They were
lying at a depth of 9 feet below the surface, and had evidently
lain undisturbed since the time of the Roman occupation.&nbsp;
From the marks upon them it was manifest that they had been used,
and it is now known from the statements of the Roman historian
Pliny, and the Greek Herodotus, that the use of narcotic fumes
was not unknown to the Romans, as well as to other ancient
nations; the material used was hemp seed and cypress grass.&nbsp;
In the Berlin Ethnological Museum, also, vessels of clay are
preserved, which are supposed to have been used for a like
purpose.&nbsp; This discovery, then, at Horncastle is very
interesting as adding to our Roman remains, and we may picture to
ourselves the Roman sentinel taking his beat on the old castle
walls and solacing himself, after the manner of his countrymen,
with his pipe.&nbsp; (An account of this later discovery is given
in a German scientific review for August, 1904, quoted
<i>Standard</i>, August 12, 1904).</p>
<p>Of what may be called the close of this early historic period
in connection with Horncastle there is little more to be
said.&nbsp; The Roman forces withdrew from Britain about A.D.
408.&nbsp; The Britons harried by their northern neighbours, the
Picts and Scots, applied for assistance to the Saxons, who,
coming at first as friends, but led to stay by the attractions of
the country, gradually <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>over-ran the land and themselves in
turn over-mastered the Britons, driving them into Wales and
Cornwall.&nbsp; The only matter of interest in connection with
Horncastle, in this struggle between Saxon and Briton, is that
about the end of the 5th century the Saxon King Horsa, with his
brother Hengist, who had greatly improved the fort at Horncastle,
were defeated in a fight at Tetford by the Britons under their
leader Raengeires, and the British King caused the walls to be
nearly demolished and the place rendered defenceless.&nbsp;
(Leland&rsquo;s <i>Collectanea</i>, vol i, pt. ii, p. 509).</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Saxons in their turn, towards the close of the 8th
century, were harassed by marauding incursions of the Danes, <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> which continued, though temporarily
checked by Kings Egbert and Alfred, through many years, both <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>nations eventually settling side by side, until both
alike in the 11th century became subject to their Norman
conquerors.&nbsp; The traces of these peoples are still apparent
in Horncastle and its soke, since of its 13 parish names, three,
High Toynton, Low Toynton and Roughton have the Saxon suffix
&ldquo;ton&rdquo;; three, Mareham-on-the-Hill, Mareham-le-Fen and
Haltham terminate in the Saxon &ldquo;ham,&rdquo; and six,
Thimbleby, West Ashby, Wood Enderby, Moorby, Wilksby and
Coningsby have the Danish suffix &ldquo;by.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name
of the town itself is Saxon, Horn-castle, or more anciently
Hyrne-ceastre, <i>i.e.</i> the castle in the corner, <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> or angle, formed by the junction of the
two rivers; that junction was, within comparatively modern times,
not where it is now, but some 200 yards eastward, on the other
side of the field called &ldquo;The Holms,&rdquo; where there is
still a muddy ditch.</p>
<p>So far our account of the town has been based mainly upon
etymological evidence, derived from river and place names, with a
few scanty and scattered records.&nbsp; As we arrive at the
Norman period we shall have to deal with more direct documentary
testimony, which may well form another chapter.</p>

RECORDS OF THE MANOR, &amp;c., FROM THE NORMAN CONQUEST.</h2>
<p>A recent historian <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a> has said &ldquo;In
the 13th century the northern counties of England were so
unsettled that there was little security north of the Humber, and
in 1250 the powerful Bishop of Carlisle found it necessary to buy
the manor of Horncastle (his own residence in the north, Rose
Castle, having been destroyed by marauders), and the Pope granted
him the Parish Church (of Horncastle) for his use;&rdquo; <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a> but we can carry our history back to a
considerably earlier period than this.&nbsp; As a former Roman
station, doubtless, and of even earlier origin than that,
Horncastle had become a place of some importance, and so, even
before the Norman conquest the manor was royal property, since
<i>Domesday Book</i> states that King Edward the Confessor
bestowed it upon his Queen, Editha.&nbsp; Edward died January 5,
1066, and his possessions naturally passed to his successor, the
Conqueror.&nbsp; Its subsequent history for a few years we do not
know, but in the reign of Stephen the manor was held by Adelias,
or Adelidis, (Alice or Adelaide) de Cundi, daughter of William de
Cheney <a name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a> (a name still known in the county),
who was Lord of Glentham and Caenby, two parishes near
Brigg.&nbsp; She had a castle in this town, the site of which is
not now known, but it was probably a restoration in whole, or in
part, of the old fortress.&nbsp; She took part against the King
in his quarrel with the Empress Maud, and her estates were
confiscated by Stephen, they were, however, subsequently restored
to her on condition that she should demolish her castle.</p>
<p>On her death the manor reverted to the crown and was granted
by Henry II. to a Fleming noble, Gerbald de Escald, who held it
for one knight&rsquo;s <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>fee. <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his grandson and heir, Gerard de Rhodes, <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> whose son, Ralph de Rhodes, sold it to
Walter Mauclerk, <a name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a> Bishop of Carlisle, and Treasurer of
the Exchequer under Henry III.&nbsp; In the reign of Richard II.
Roger la Scrope and Margaret his wife, with Robert Tibetot and
son, his wife, as descendants of Gerbald de Escald, <a
name="citation12d"></a><a href="#footnote12d"
class="citation">[12d]</a> put in a claim for the manor and
obtained letters patent, by which the episcopal possessor was
bound to do them homage, but this was only for a brief period,
and they then disappear from the scene.</p>
<p>The manor remained a possession of the bishops of Carlisle
until the reign of Edward VI., when, by licence of the King, it
was sold by Bishop Aldrich in 1547 to Edward, Lord Clinton. <a
name="citation12e"></a><a href="#footnote12e"
class="citation">[12e]</a>&nbsp; In the reign of Mary he was
compelled to re-convey it to the see of Carlisle. <a
name="citation12f"></a><a href="#footnote12f"
class="citation">[12f]</a>&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth took a lease of
it under the then possessing bishop, in which she was succeeded
by James I.&nbsp; He assigned it to Sir Edward Clinton, knt., but
through neglect of enrolment this became void. <a
name="citation12g"></a><a href="#footnote12g"
class="citation">[12g]</a>&nbsp; In the reign of Charles II. the
former charters were renewed, <a name="citation12h"></a><a
href="#footnote12h" class="citation">[12h]</a> and the bishops of
Carlisle remained lords of the manor until 1856, when it was
transferred, with the patronage of some of the benefices within
the soke, to the Bishop of Lincoln.&nbsp; Thus from the reign of
Edward the Confessor to that of Charles II., a period of about
600 years, broken by brief intervals of alienation, Horncastle
was connected with royalty.</p>
<p>The lease of the manor was held, under the bishops of Carlisle
by Sir Joseph Banks and his ancestors for nearly a century, the
lease of Sir Joseph himself being dated 21 March, 1803, and
renewed 1 June, 1811.&nbsp; He died in 1820 and was succeeded by
his relative the Honble. James Hamilton Stanhope and, three years
later, by James Banks Stanhope, Esq., then a minor, who, at a
later period (in 1885) transferred all his rights to his cousin,
the late Right Honble. Edward Stanhope, whose widow became lady
of the manor and at whose death, in 1907, the lordship reverted
to the Honble. Richard Stanhope, son of the present Earl
Stanhope.&nbsp; Mr. Banks Stanhope died January 18th, 1904, aged
82, having been a generous benefactor to Horncastle and the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We have here given a very condensed account of the ownership
of this manor from the reign of Edward the Confessor to the
present time, a period of nearly 840 years.&nbsp; Having had
access to the episcopal archives of Carlisle, so long connected
with Horncastle, we are able to confirm several of the above
details from documents still existing, which we now proceed to
do.</p>
<p>It has been stated that the manor of Horncastle was conferred
upon Queen Editha by her husband, Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; In
confirmation of this we find the following: In the reign of
Charles I. the Vicar of Horncastle, Thomas Gibson, presented a
petition claiming tithe for certain mills called &ldquo;Hall
Mills,&rdquo; with a close adjoining called &ldquo;Mill
Holmes,&rdquo; as belonging to the glebe.&nbsp; The tenant,
William Davidson, resisted, arguing that he had paid no tithes to
the previous vicar, Robert Holingshed, that the mills were
erected <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>before the conquest and were part of
the jointure of Queen Editha, as stated in <i>Domesday Book</i>,
and were therefore part of the manor, not of the vicar&rsquo;s
glebe.&nbsp; The result is not recorded, but doubtless the tenant
was right. <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; The passage here quoted from
<i>Domesday Book</i> is the following: &ldquo;In Horncastre Queen
Editha had 3 carucates of land, free of gelt.&nbsp; This land is
now 4 carucates.&nbsp; The King has there 2 carucates in demesne
(<i>i.e.</i> as his manor), with 29 villeins and 12 bordars, who
have (among them) 3 carucates.&nbsp; There are 2 mills worth 26s.
yearly, and 100 acres of meadow.&nbsp; In King Edward&rsquo;s
time the annual value was &pound;20, now it is &pound;44.&rdquo;
<a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; These two mills and the meadow
were doubtless those in dispute between the vicar and tenant in
the reign of Charles I., the date of <i>Domesday</i> being about
1085, or 540 years earlier.&nbsp; They were plainly part of the
royal manor and not at all connected with the glebe.</p>
<p>All this, however, proves that the manor of Horncastle
belonged to King Edward the Confessor before the conquest, and
360 acres of it were assigned to his consort, Queen Editha.&nbsp;
The expansion of the 3 carucates into 4, mentioned in <i>Domesday
Book</i>, was probably (as in many other recorded cases) due to
the reclamation of land hitherto waste in flood or forest.</p>
<p>On the death of King Edward in 1066 the royal demesnes
naturally passed to his successor and kinsman, William the
Conqueror, and in due course to the successive Norman kings of
his line.</p>
<p>The connection of Horncastle with the sovereign is shown in
various ways.&nbsp; Documents relating to the earlier kings are
naturally rare, since for many years law courts were hardly yet
established, the royal power being rather that of
&ldquo;might&rdquo; than of &ldquo;right.&rdquo; <a
name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c"
class="citation">[13c]</a>&nbsp; Even the sale, or devising, of
property could only be legally effected by the king&rsquo;s
licence.&nbsp; Among the Carlisle papers connected with
Horncastle is one which shows that a matter which in modern times
would be settled by the parish overseers, or more recently by the
Urban Council, was to be formerly carried out only by the royal
sanction.&nbsp; There is a Patent Roll of the 13th year of King
Richard II. (pt. 1, m. 3) entitled &ldquo;Concerning the paving
of Horncastre,&rdquo; and running as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The
King to the Bailiff and proved men of the vill of Horncastre,
greeting.&nbsp; Know, that in aid of paving your said vill, of
our special grace we have granted to you, that from the day of
the making of these presents to the end of 3 years, you may take,
for things coming to the said vill for sale, the customs
underwritten.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then follows a long list of articles
for sale, of which we can only specify a few here, viz.:
&ldquo;For every horse load of corn, &frac14;d., for every dole
of wine, 2d.; for every pipe of ditto, 1s.; for every hide,
fresh, salt, or tanned, &frac14;d.; for 100 skins of roebucks (it
seems that there were wild deer in those days), hares, rabbits,
foxes, or squirrels, &frac12;d.; for every horse load of cloth,
&frac12;d.; for every cloth of worstede, called
&lsquo;coverlyt,&rsquo; value 40s., 1d.; for every 100 of linen
web of Aylesham, 1d.; for every chief of strong cendal (silk)
1d.; for 100 mullets, salt or dry, 1d.; for every cart of fish,
1d.; for every horse load of sea fish, &frac14;d.; for every
salmon, &frac14;d.; for every last of herrings (12 barrels), 6d.;
for every horse load of honey, 1d.; for every wey of tallow (256
lbs.), 1d.; for every milstone, &frac12;d.; for 1,000 turfs,
&frac14;d.&nbsp; For every other <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>kind of
merchandise not here specified, of value 5s. and over,
&frac14;d.; and the term of 3 years being ended, the said customs
shall cease.&nbsp; Witness the King, at Westminster, 9 Nov.,
1389.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly the kingly government was a paternal one to take
cognizance of such petty local matters.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;coggle&rdquo; pavement of Horncastle is often complained
of, but at least it had the royal sanction.</p>
<p>A Roll of the 18th year of Edward III. (m 8), dated
Westminster, 28 June, 1344, is directed &ldquo;to his very dear
and faithful John de Kirketon, Fitz Hugh de Cressy,&rdquo; (and
others) assigning them &ldquo;to choose and array 100 men at arms
in the County of Lincoln,&rdquo; and (among others) &ldquo;6
hoblers in the vill of Horncastre, to be at Portsmouth, to set
out with the King against Philip VI., de Valesco
(Valois).&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the beginning of the campaign of
Edward and his son the Black Prince, which terminated with the
glorious battle of Cressy and the capture of Calais.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hoblers&rdquo; were a sort of yeomanry who, by the terms
of their tenure of land were bound to keep a light
&ldquo;nag&rdquo; for military service.</p>
<p>A Domestic State Paper of Queen Elizabeth (Vol. 51, No. 12,
III) contains the &ldquo;Certificate of the town and soke of
Horncastle to the artycles of the Queen&rsquo;s Majesty&rsquo;s
most Honorable Pryvye Councell,&rdquo; dated 27 June, 1569,
shewing what &ldquo;soldiers were furnished and went forth under
Captaine Carsey.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were formerly the well-known
local troops called &ldquo;trainbands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The paper
contains, further, accounts of payments for &ldquo;towne common
armour, jerkyns, swords, daggers, corslettes, 1 caline (piece of
ordnance), conduct money (<i>i.e.</i> hire money), pioneers,
victuals,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Accounts rendered by Thomas
Hamerton, Arthur Patchytt, Thomas Raythbeake (all formerly well
known names in the town), and others.</p>
<p>The head of the Carsey family was the owner of the Revesby
Abbey Estate, and as such was lesse of the manor of Horncastle
under the Bishop of Carlisle.&nbsp; They sold their property, in
1575, to Thomas Cecil, son of Lord Treasurer Burleigh.</p>
<p>There is another Carlisle document in connection with these
trained bands among the same Domestic State Papers of Queen
Elizabeth (Vol. 199, No. 7), in which the Earl of Rutland writes
to Anthony Thorold, sheriff, that he has instructions &ldquo;from
the Lords of the Counsaile to put in strength the power of the
realme for the maritime counties,&rdquo; and he asks him to
&ldquo;choose captaines for the yet untrained companies, and to
supply the place of Mr. John Savile for Horncastle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
N.B.&mdash;The Saviles owned Poolham Hall in Edlington.&nbsp; On
this (State Papers, Eliz., Vol. 199, No. 72) the Earl writes to
Mr. Valentine Brown that he thinks him &ldquo;meete to supply the
place for Horncastle,&rdquo; dated London, 29 March,
1586&ndash;7.&nbsp; Sir Valentine Brown was of Croft and East
Kirkby, and Treasurer of Ireland; he married the daughter of Sir
John Monson, ancestor of the present Lord Oxenbridge.</p>
<p>Among the Domestic State Papers of Charles I. (Vol. 376, No.
123), is a petition from the inhabitants of Horncastle to Sir
Anthony Irbie, Knt., sheriff of the county, complaining that the
town was over-rated for the payment of &ldquo;ship-money,&rdquo;
and praying for a reduction of the same.&nbsp; The county was
charged &pound;8,000.&nbsp; This rate, levied to maintain the
navy, created widespread dissatisfaction and eventually led to
the revolution.&nbsp; It was included among the grievances
against which public protests were made in 1641.&nbsp; The five
judges who pronounced in its favour were imprisoned, and Hampden
received <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>a wound in a skirmish with Prince
Rupert, from which he died, June 24, 1643.&nbsp; Petitions were
also presented to Sir Edward Hussey, sheriff, 1636&ndash;7, as
given in Domestic State Papers, Charles I., Vol. 345, No. 42.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It has been already stated that in the reign of Stephen this
manor was held by Adelias, or Adelidis, de Cundi.&nbsp; How this
came about is not quite clear, whether it was inherited from her
father, William de Cheney, who was probably among the Normans
invited to immigrate by Edward the Confessor, since it would seem
that at the time of the conquest he was already a large owner in
the county, or from her husband, Robert de Cundi, a Fleming,
probably named from the town and fortress of Conde on the
frontier of France, situated on the Scheldt, in the department du
Nord.&nbsp; There is, however, evidence to show that she had
other possessions of considerable value apparently in her own
right in Nottinghamshire and Kent, as well as Lincolnshire. <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; She is described by the old
chronicler, Geoffrey Gairmar, <a name="citation16b"></a><a
href="#footnote16b" class="citation">[16b]</a> as a great
patroness of learning and literature.</p>
<p>The Cheneys, or Chesneys, were apparently of foreign
extraction, as implied by their appellation &ldquo;de
Casineto.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had considerable influence at various
periods, one of them being knighted, another made a baron by
Queen Elizabeth. <a name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a>&nbsp; One, Robert de Cheney, was a
powerful Bishop of Lincoln (A.D. 1147&ndash;67) and built one of
the finest castles in England, the ruins of which still remain in
the Palace grounds at Lincoln. <a name="citation16d"></a><a
href="#footnote16d" class="citation">[16d]</a>&nbsp; The Cheney
pedigree is given in <i>The Genealogist</i> of July, 1901.&nbsp;
They seem to have settled in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire, as
well as in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Cheney, K.G., was Lord
Warden of the Cinque Ports in the latter part of the 16th
century.&nbsp; The Cheneys fell into decay towards the end of the
17th century, and at the beginning of the 18th century we find
them in trade at Boston.&nbsp; About 1750 William Garfit of
Boston married Mary, daughter of Thomas Cheney, and the name, as
a Christian name, still survives in that family.&nbsp; The
Cheneys, we may add, were among the ancestors of the Willoughbys,
<a name="citation16e"></a><a href="#footnote16e"
class="citation">[16e]</a> and the parish of Cheneys, in Bucks.,
doubtless named after them, is now the property of the Duke of
Bedford.</p>
<p>The granddaughter of Adelias de Cundi, Agnes, <a
name="citation16f"></a><a href="#footnote16f"
class="citation">[16f]</a> married Walter, son of Walter de
Clifford of Clifford Castle, Hereford.&nbsp; Walter Clifford is
named in the first great charter of Henry III. (A.D. 1216), along
with the great nobles Walter de Lacy, William de Ferrars, Earl of
Derby, William, Earl of Albemarle, and others.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>William de Cheney, already mentioned as father of
Adelias de Cundi, was &ldquo;Lord of Caenby and Glentham,&rdquo;
and Walter de Clifford also is mentioned in the charters of
Barlings Abbey as giving to that monastery lands in Caenby and
Glentham, along with the above Walter de Lacy.&nbsp; The great
feature of the reign of Stephen was the large number of castles
erected by lords who were almost more powerful than their
sovereign, and Adelias built her castle at Horncastle, where she
resided in great state until, on her favouring the cause of the
Empress Maud, daughter of the previous king, Henry I. (whereas
Stephen was only his nephew), her lands were confiscated, and, as
we have already seen, only restored on condition that her castle
was demolished. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; This restoration was, however,
only for life and on her demise the manor reverted to the
crown.</p>
<p>The manor was next granted by Henry II. to Gerbald de Escald,
a Flemish noble. <a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a>&nbsp; This is shewn by a record still
preserved at Carlisle, dated 1274&ndash;5.&nbsp; In the reign of
Edward I. an inquisition was made at Lincoln, before 12 jurors of
the soke of Horncastle, among the Commissioners being John de
Haltham, Anselm de Rugthon (Roughton), Thomas de Camera
(<i>i.e.</i> Chambers) of Horncastre, the King&rsquo;s Justices
and others, when it was declared that &ldquo;the Lord Henry III.,
the father of King Edward who now is, once had the manor of
Horncastre, and he enfeoffed Gerbald de Escald, a knight of
Flanders, thereof, for his service, viz., by doing one
knight&rsquo;s fee for the Lord the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gerbald was succeeded by his grandson and heir, Gerard de
Rhodes.&nbsp; This is shewn by a Carlisle document. <a
name="citation17c"></a><a href="#footnote17c"
class="citation">[17c]</a>&nbsp; A dispute arose between Hugh,
son of Ralph (surname not given) and Gerard de Rhodes, concerning
the manor and soke of Horncastle, the advowson of the church,
&amp;c., which were claimed by the said Hugh; but a compromise
was effected, 400 marks being paid to Hugh, and Gerard de Rhodes
left in undisputed possession.</p>
<p>It has been thought probable that this Ralph, father of Hugh,
was Ranulph, Earl of Chester, who was lord of the manors of
Revesby and Hareby, and had other possessions in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; He, it is supposed, held the manor of
Horncastle, as trustee, during the minority of Gerard.&nbsp;
Gerard was, in due course, succeeded by his son and heir, Ralph
de Rhodes, in the reign of Henry III.&nbsp; This again is proved
by a Feet of Fines, <a name="citation17d"></a><a
href="#footnote17d" class="citation">[17d]</a> which records an
&ldquo;agreement made in the court of the Lord King at
Westminster (3 Feb., A.D. 1224&ndash;5), between Henry del Ortiay
and Sabina his wife on the one part, and the said Ralph de Rhodes
on the other part,&rdquo; whereby the former acknowledge certain
lands and appurtenances in Horncastle and its soke to be the
property of the said Ralph, and he grants to them, as his
tenants, certain lands; they, in acknowledgement,
&ldquo;rendering him therefor, by the year, one pair of gilt
spurs at Easter for all service and exactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have now reached another stage in the tenure of this manor
and find ourselves once more at the point where the present
chapter opened.&nbsp; Hitherto the manor had been held &ldquo;in
capite&rdquo; (or &ldquo;in chief&rdquo;) of the king by lay
lords, or, in the two cases of Queen Editha and Adelias de Condi,
by a lady; <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>but in this reign Walter Mauclerk,
the third Bishop of Carlisle, purchased the manor from Ralph de
Rhodes.&nbsp; He was himself a powerful Norman and held the
office of Treasurer of the Exchequer (a common combination of
civil and ecclesiastical duties in those days), but now he and
his successors were bound &ldquo;to do suit and service to Ralph
and his heirs.&rdquo;&nbsp; This purchase is proved by a Lincoln
document called a &ldquo;Plea Quo Warranto,&rdquo; which records
a case argued before the Justices Itinerant, in the reign of
Edward I., when it was stated that Ralph de Rhodes
&ldquo;enfeoffed Walter Mauclerk to hold the church, manor and
appurtenances in Horncastre, to him and his heirs, of the gift of
the said Ralph.&rdquo; <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; That the
Bishop, although an ecclesiastic, was bound to do service to the
heirs of Ralph is shown by another document, <a
name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b"
class="citation">[18b]</a> in which John, son of Gerard de
Rhodes, a descendant of Ralph, makes a grant to certain parties
of &ldquo;the homage and whole service of the Bishop of Carlisle,
and his successors, for the manor (&amp;c.) of Horncastre, which
Gerard, son of Gerard my brother, granted to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is dated the 13th year of Edward I., 1285, whereas the
actual sale of the manor took place in the reign of Henry III.,
A.D. 1230, and was confirmed by the king in the same year. <a
name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c"
class="citation">[18c]</a></p>
<p>We have called this another stage in the tenure of this manor
and for this reason, an ecclesiastic of high rank, with the
authority of the Pope of Rome at his back, was a more powerful
subject than any lay baron, and this influence soon shewed
itself, for while the lay lords of the manor had been content
with doing their service to the king, and exacting service from
those holding under them, the Bishop of Carlisle, in the first
year of his tenure, obtained from the king three charters,
conferring on the town of Horncastle immunities and privileges,
which had the effect of raising the town from the status of
little more than a village to that of the general mart of the
surrounding country.&nbsp; The first of these charters gave the
bishop, as lord of the manor, the right of free warren throughout
the soke <a name="citation18d"></a><a href="#footnote18d"
class="citation">[18d]</a>; the second gave him licence to hold
an annual fair two days before the feast of St. Barnabas (June
11), to continue eight days; the third empowered him to hang
felons.&nbsp; An additional charter was granted in the following
year empowering the bishop to hold a weekly market on Wednesday
(die Mercurii), which was afterwards changed to Saturday, on
which day it is still held; also to hold another fair on the eve
of the Feast of St. Laurence (Aug. 10th), to continue seven days.
<a name="citation18e"></a><a href="#footnote18e"
class="citation">[18e]</a></p>
<p>We here quote a few words of the original Carlisle charter, as
shewing the style of such documents in those days: &ldquo;Henry
to all Bishops, Bailiffs, Provosts, servants, &amp;c.,
health.&nbsp; Know that we, by the guidance of God, and <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>for
the health of our soul, and of the souls of our ancestors and
descendants, have granted, and confirmed by this present charter,
to God, and the church of the blessed Mary of Carlisle, and to
the Venerable Father, Walter, Bishop of Carlisle,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; It then goes on to specify, among other privileges,
that the bishop shall have &ldquo;all chattells of felons and
fugitives, all amerciaments and fines from all men and tenants of
the manor and soke; that the bishop and his successors shall be
quit for ever to the king of all mercies, fines (&amp;c.), that
no constable of the king shall have power of entry, but that the
whole shall pertain to the said bishop, except attachments
touching pleas of the crown, and that all chattells, &amp;c.,
either in the king&rsquo;s court, or any other, shall be the
bishop&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then follow cases in which chattells
of Robert Mawe, a fugitive, were demanded by the bishop, and
&pound;24 exacted from the township of Horncastle in lieu
thereof; also 40s. from William, son of Drogo de Horncastre, for
trespass, and other fines from Ralph Ascer, bailiff.&nbsp; Robert
de Kirkby, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; The same document states that
the bishop has a gallows (furc&aelig;) at Horncastle for hanging
offenders within the soke; and, in connection with this we may
observe that in the south of the town is still a point called
&ldquo;Hangman&rsquo;s Corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These extensive powers, however, would hardly seem (to use the
words of the charter) to have been &ldquo;for the good of the
souls&rdquo; of the bishop or his successors, since they rather
had the effect of leading him to the abuse of his rights.&nbsp;
Accordingly, in the reign of Edward III., a plea was entered at
Westminster, before the King&rsquo;s Justices, <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a> by which John, Bishop of Carlisle, was
charged with resisting the authority of the king in the matter of
the patronage of the benefice of Horncastle.&nbsp; That benefice
was usually in the gift of the bishop, but the rector, Simon de
Islip, had been appointed by the king Archbishop of Canterbury
and, in such circumstances, the crown by custom presents to the
vacancy.&nbsp; The bishop resisted and proceeded to appoint his
own nominee, but the judgment of the court was against him.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar case occurred a few years later. <a
name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a>&nbsp; Thomas de Appleby, the Bishop of
Carlisle, and John de Rouseby, clerk, were &ldquo;summoned to
answer to the Lord the King, that they permit him to appoint to
the church of Horncastre, vacant, and belonging to the
king&rsquo;s gift, by reason of the bishopric of Carlisle being
recently vacant.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was argued that John de Kirkby,
Bishop of Carlisle, had presented Simon de Islip to that
benefice, afterwards created Archbishop of Canterbury, and that
the temporalities (patronage, &amp;c.) of the Bishopric of
Carlisle therefore (for that turn) came to the king by the death
of John de Kirkby, bishop.&nbsp; The said bishop, Thomas de
Appleby, and John de Rouseby brought the case before the court,
but they admitted the justice of the king&rsquo;s plea and
judgment was given for the king.</p>
<p>We have said that although Walter Mauclerk, as Bishop of
Carlisle, bought this manor from Ralph de Rhodes, he and his
successors were still bound to &ldquo;do suit and service&rdquo;
to Ralph and his heirs, and in the brief summary with which this
chapter opened we named Roger le Scrope and Margaret his wife,
with Robert Tibetot and Eva his wife, among those descendants of
Ralph de Rhodes.&nbsp; We have fuller mention of them in
documents which we here quote.&nbsp; In a Roll of the reign of
Edward I., <a name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a> John, son <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of Gerard de
Rhodes, says &ldquo;Know all, present and future, that I, John,
son of Gerard, have granted, and by this charter confirmed, to
the Lord Robert Tibetot and Eva his wife (among other things) the
homage and whole service of the Bishop of Carlisle, and his
successors, for the manor of Horncastre, with appurtenances,
&amp;c., which Gerard, son of Gerard my brother, granted to me,
&amp;c., to have and to hold of the Lord the King . . . rendering
for them annually to me and my heirs &pound;80
sterling.&rdquo;&nbsp; While in another Roll <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a> of the reign of Richard II., the king
states that having inspected the above he confirms the grants,
not only to the said &ldquo;Robert Tybetot and his wife
Eve,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;to our very dear and faithful Roger
le Scrope and Margaret his wife,&rdquo; recognizing them, it
would seem, as descendants of the earlier grantee, Gerbald de
Escald, from whom they all inherited.</p>
<p>Of these personages we may here say that both Tibetots and Le
Scrope were of high position and influence.&nbsp; The name of
Thebetot, or Tibetot, is found in the Battle Abbey Roll, as given
by the historians Stow and Holinshed; <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a> with a slight variation of name, as
Tibtofts, they were Lords of Langer, Co. Notts., and afterwards
Earls of Worcester. <a name="citation20c"></a><a
href="#footnote20c" class="citation">[20c]</a>&nbsp; According to
the historian, Camden, John Tibtoft was Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland under Henry VI., created by him Earl of Worcester, but
executed for treason. <a name="citation20d"></a><a
href="#footnote20d" class="citation">[20d]</a>&nbsp; His
successor, John, was Lord Deputy under Edward IV. <a
name="citation20e"></a><a href="#footnote20e"
class="citation">[20e]</a>&nbsp; The last of the Tibetots,
Robert, died without male issue; his three daughters were under
the guardianship of Richard le Scrope, who married the eldest
daughter, Margaret, to his son Roger.&nbsp; This is the one named
above in connection with Horncastle.&nbsp; The Tibetot property
of Langer, Notts., thus passed to the Le Scropes, and continued
in that family down to Emanuel, created Earl of Sunderland by
Charles I., AD. 1628. <a name="citation20f"></a><a
href="#footnote20f" class="citation">[20f]</a>&nbsp; Castle Combe
in Wiltshire was one of their residences, <a
name="citation20g"></a><a href="#footnote20g"
class="citation">[20g]</a> but their chief seat was Bolton in
Richmondshire. <a name="citation20h"></a><a href="#footnote20h"
class="citation">[20h]</a>&nbsp; William le Scrope was created
Earl of Wiltshire by Richard II., but beheaded when that king was
dethroned and murdered, in 1399. <a name="citation20i"></a><a
href="#footnote20i" class="citation">[20i]</a>&nbsp; Richard le
Scrope was Archbishop of York, but condemned by Henry IV. for
treason. <a name="citation20j"></a><a href="#footnote20j"
class="citation">[20j]</a>&nbsp; The name Le Scrope also appears
in the Battle Abbey Roll of the Conqueror.&nbsp; Thus in both
Tibetots and Scropes Horncastle was connected with families who
played a considerable part in public life.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward VI. there was a temporary change in the
ownership of this manor.&nbsp; Among the Carlisle Papers is one
<a name="citation20k"></a><a href="#footnote20k"
class="citation">[20k]</a> by which that king grants permission
to Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle, to sell &ldquo;to our very
dear and faithful councellor, Edward Fynes, K.G., Lord Clinton
and Saye, High Admiral of England, the lordship and soke of
Horncastre, with all rights, appurtenances, &amp;c., to hold to
himself, his heirs and assigns for ever,&rdquo; and that he, the
said Edward, &ldquo;can give and grant to the said Robert,
bishop, an <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>annual rent of &pound;28 6s.
8d.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have, however, in this case an illustration
of the instability even of royal decrees, in that on the demise
of that worthy prince, to whom the realm and Church of England
owe so much, his successor, Queen Mary, in the very next year,
A.D. 1553, cancelled this sale, and a document exists at Carlisle
<a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a> showing that she &ldquo;granted a
licence,&rdquo; probably in effect compulsory, to the same Lord
Clinton and Saye, &ldquo;to alienate his lordship and soke of
Horncastle and to re-convey it to Robert Aldrich, Bishop of
Carlisle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Lordship would, however, appear to have continued to hold
the manor on lease under the bishop, and to have acted in a
somewhat high-handed manner to his spiritual superior, probably
under the influence of the change in religious sentiment between
the reigns of &ldquo;the bloody Mary,&rdquo; and her sister
Elizabeth of glorious memory.&nbsp; For again we find a document
<a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a> of the reign of the latter, in which
the Bishop of Carlisle complains to Sir Francis Walsingham, the
Queen&rsquo;s Commissioner, of a &ldquo;book of
Horncastle,&rdquo; which the Earl of Lincoln (the new title of
Lord Clinton and Saye) had sent to him &ldquo;to be
sealed,&rdquo; because (he says) the earl, by the words of the
grant, had taken from him &ldquo;lands and tithes of the yearly
value of &pound;28 6s. 8d.,&rdquo; the exact sum, be it observed,
above specified as the rent to be paid by Lord Clinton and Saye
to the bishop, Robert Aldrich.&nbsp; Of this, he asserts,
&ldquo;the see of Carlisle is seized and the earl is not in legal
possession by his lease now &lsquo;in esse.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation21c"></a><a href="#footnote21c"
class="citation">[21c]</a>&nbsp; He wages his suit &ldquo;the
more boldly, because of the extraordinary charges he has been at,
from the lamentable scarcity in the country, the great multitude
of poor people, and other charges before he came had made him a
poor man, and yet he must go on with it . . . the number of them
which want food to keep their lives in their bodies is so
pitiful.&nbsp; If the Lord Warden and he did not charge
themselves a great number would die of hunger, and some have done
so,&rdquo; dated Rose Castle, 26 May, 1578.</p>
<p>His lordship, however, did one good turn to the town of
Horncastle in founding the Grammar School, in the 13th year of
the reign of Elizabeth, A.D. 1571, although (as we shall show in
our chapter on the school) this was really not strictly a
foundation but a re-establishment; as a grammar school is known
to have existed in the town more than two centuries earlier.</p>
<p>We have one more record of Lord Clinton&rsquo;s connection
with the town, from which it would appear that the Priory of
Bullington, near Wragby, and Kirkstead Abbey also had property in
Horncastle.&nbsp; A Carlisle document <a
name="citation21d"></a><a href="#footnote21d"
class="citation">[21d]</a> shows that in the reign of Edward VI.
Lord Clinton and Saye received a grant of &ldquo;lands, tenements
and hereditaments in Horncastle, late in the <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>tenure of
Alexander Rose and his assigns, and formerly of the dissolved
monastery of Bollington; also two tenements, one house, two
&lsquo;lez bark houses&rsquo; (Horncastle tanners would seem even
then to have flourished), one house called &lsquo;le kylne
howse,&rsquo; one &lsquo;le garthing,&rsquo; 14 terrages of land
in the fields of Thornton, with appurtenances lying in
Horncastle, &amp;c., and once belonging to the monastery of
Kyrkestead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As in other places the Clinton family seem to have been
succeeded by the Thymelbys, of these we have several
records.&nbsp; An Escheator&rsquo;s Inquisition of the reign of
Henry VIII., <a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a> taken by Roger Hilton, at Horncastle,
Oct. 5, 1512, shewed that &ldquo;Richard Thymylby, Esquire, was
seized of the manor of Parish-fee, in Horncastre, held of the
Bishop of Carlisle, as of his soke of Horncastre, by fealty, and
a rent of &pound;7 by the year.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was also
&ldquo;seized of one messuage, with appurtenances, in Horncastre,
called Fool-thyng, parcel of the said manor of Parish-fee.&rdquo;
<a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a>&nbsp; The said Richard died 3 March, 3
Henry VIII. (A.D. 1512).&nbsp; This was, however, by no means the
first of this family connected with Horncastle.&nbsp; Deriving
their name from the parish of Thimbleby, in the soke of
Horncastle, we find the first mention of a Thymelby in that
parish in a post mortem Inquisition of the reign of Edward III.,
<a name="citation22c"></a><a href="#footnote22c"
class="citation">[22c]</a> which shews that Nicholas de Thymelby
then held land in Thimbleby under the Bishop of Carlisle, A.D.
1333; but nearly a century before that date a Lincoln document <a
name="citation22d"></a><a href="#footnote22d"
class="citation">[22d]</a> mentions one Ivo, son of Odo de
Thymelby, as holding under the Bishop in Horncastle, in the reign
of Henry III., A.D. 1248.</p>
<p>Further, in the reign of Edward I., as is shewn by a Harleian
MS., in the British Museum, <a name="citation22e"></a><a
href="#footnote22e" class="citation">[22e]</a> Richard de
Thymelby was Dean of Horncastle; Thomas, son of the above
Nicholas de Thymelby, presented to the benefice of Ruckland in
1381, John de Thymelby presented to Tetford in 1388, and John
again to Somersby in 1394, <a name="citation22f"></a><a
href="#footnote22f" class="citation">[22f]</a> and other members
of the family presented at later periods.&nbsp; The family
continued to advance in wealth and position until in the reign of
Edward VI. it was found by an Inquisition <a
name="citation22g"></a><a href="#footnote22g"
class="citation">[22g]</a> that Matthew Thymelby, of Poolham
(their chief residence in this neighbourhood), owned the manor of
Thymbleby, that of Parish-fee in Horncastle and five others, with
lands in eight other parishes, and the advowsons of Ruckland,
Farforth, Somersby and Tetford.&nbsp; He married Anne, daughter
of Sir Robert Hussey.&nbsp; Other influential marriages were
those of John Thymelby, &ldquo;Lord of Polum&rdquo; (Poolham), to
Isabel, <a name="citation22h"></a><a href="#footnote22h"
class="citation">[22h]</a> daughter of Sir John Fflete, Knt.
(circa 1409); William (probably) to Joan, daughter of Sir Walter
Tailboys (circa 1432), <a name="citation22i"></a><a
href="#footnote22i" class="citation">[22i]</a> a connection of
the Earl of Angus; Matthew&rsquo;s widow marrying Sir Robert
Savile, Knt. <a name="citation22j"></a><a href="#footnote22j"

Tailboys we may mention that the base, all that now remains, of
the churchyard cross at Tetford bears on its west side the
Thimbleby arms &ldquo;differenced&rdquo; with those of Tailboys,
the north side having the Thimbleby arms pure and simple. <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a></p>
<p>Another important marriage was that of Richard Thimbleby (A.D.
1510) to Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Godfrey Hilton of
Irnham Manor near Grantham, through which alliance that property
passed to the Thimblebys.&nbsp; It had been granted to Ralph
Paganel by the Conqueror, afterwards passed to Sir Andrew
Luterel, Knt., and later to Sir Geoffrey Hilton, Knt.&nbsp;
Richard Thimbleby built Irnham Hall; he was succeeded by his son
and heir, Sir John Thimbleby, who thus became the head of the
family, which has in later times become almost extinct.&nbsp;
This fine mansion, in the Tudor style of architecture, standing
in a deer park of more than 250 acres, was destroyed by fire,
Nov. 12, 1887, being then owned by W. Hervey Woodhouse, Esq., who
bought it of Lord Clifford&rsquo;s son. <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a></p>
<p>Turning again to the Carlisle documents we find one of the
reign of Edward III., <a name="citation24c"></a><a
href="#footnote24c" class="citation">[24c]</a> giving an
agreement made in the King&rsquo;s Court at Westminster (20 Jan.,
1353&ndash;4), &ldquo;between Thomas, son of Nicholas de
Thymelby, plaintiff, and Henry Colvile, knt., and Margaret his
wife, deforciants,&rdquo; whereby, among other property, the
latter acknowledge that certain &ldquo;messuages, one mill, ten
acres of land (<i>i.e.</i> arable), two pastures, and &pound;7 of
rent, with appurtenances, in Horncastre, Thimilby, and Bokeland
(<i>i.e.</i> Woodhall), are of the right of the said Thomas; and
for this the said Thomas gives to the said Henry and Margaret 200
marks of silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another document of the same reign, <a
name="citation24d"></a><a href="#footnote24d"
class="citation">[24d]</a> of date 1360&ndash;1, states that
Gilbert de Wilton, Bishop of Carlisle, &ldquo;gives 60s. for the
King&rsquo;s licence to remit to Thomas son of Nicholas de
Thymelby, and John his younger brother, the service of being
Reeve (<i>i.e.</i> Bailiff) of the Bishop, and other services,
which are due from him to the said Bishop for lands and tenements
held of the said Bishop in Horncastre,&rdquo; and
elsewhere.&nbsp; Another document, <a name="citation24e"></a><a
href="#footnote24e" class="citation">[24e]</a> dated a few years
later, shews an agreement made at Westminster, between Thomas
Thymelby and his brother John, on the one part, and Frederick de
Semerton and Amice his wife, deforciants, concerning four tofts,
certain land, and &pound;7 of rent, with appurtenances, in
Horncastre and contiguous parts, by which &ldquo;the said
Frederick and Amice acknowledge these (properties) to be of the
right of the said Thomas and his brother,&rdquo; and for this
Thomas pays them 100 marks of silver.&nbsp; Two other Carlisle
documents of considerably later date refer to members of this
same family of Thymelby, but are chiefly of value as introducing
to us a new name among Horncastle owners of land.</p>
<p>A Chancery Inquisition <a name="citation24f"></a><a
href="#footnote24f" class="citation">[24f]</a> taken at
Horncastle, 24 Sept., 1612, shews that &ldquo;John Kent, of
Langton, was seized in his manor of Horncastell, with the
appurtenances, called Parish-fee, and certain messuages,
cottages, land and meadows in Horncastell (and elsewhere), lately
purchased of Robert Savile and Richard Thymelby,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;held under the Bishop of Carlisle by fealty,&rdquo; . . .
that &ldquo;the said John Kent died 19 Sept., 1611, and that
William Kent, his son, is next heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>We have already seen that, about 60 years before, the
widow of Matthew Thymelby had married Sir Robert Savile; he
belonged to an old and influential family now represented by Lord
Savile of Rufford Abbey, Notts., and the Earl of Mexborough,
Methley Park, Yorkshire.&nbsp; By the aforesaid marriage the bulk
of the Thymelby property passed to the Saviles, and like the
Thymelbys they had their chief residence, in this neighbourhood,
at Poolham Hall, owning among many other possessions the
aforesaid sub-manor of Parish-fee in Horncastle, which, as we
have seen, was sold by their joint action to John Kent of
Langton.&nbsp; We have already had mention of a John Savile who
was apparently captain of the &ldquo;trained band&rdquo;
connected with Horncastle in the reign of Elizabeth, A.D. 1586
(see p. 14); Gervase Holles mentions this John Savile as joint
lord of Somersby with Andrew Gedney, and lord of Tetford in the
same reign. (<i>Collectanea</i>, vol. iii, p. 770).</p>
<p>From another document <a name="citation25a"></a><a
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a> it would seem
that, some 10 or 11 years later, Richard Thymelby and Robert
Savile were involved in a more than questionable transaction with
regard to the property thus transferred.&nbsp; Among the Carlisle
papers is a Petition in Chancery, of which we here give the text,
slightly abridged, as it is remarkable, and fittingly brings to a
close our notices of the Thymelbys in connection with
Horncastle.</p>
<p>To the Right Honble. Sir Francis Bacon, Knt., Lord Chancellor
of England.&nbsp; Complainant sheweth, on the oath of your
petitioner, Evan Reignolds, of St. Catherine&rsquo;s, Co.
Middlesex, gent., and Joan his wife, that, whereas Richard
Thymelby, some time of Poleham, Co. Lincoln, Esq., deceased, was
seized of the manors of Poleham, Thimbleby, Horsington, Stixwold,
Buckland, Horncastle, Edlington (&amp;c.), and tenements in
Langton, Blankney, Baumber, and in one pasture inclosed for 1000
sheep, called Heirick (High-Rig, in Woodhall, near Poolham)
pasture, &amp;c., whereof Robert Savile was seized for life,
conveyed the same to his father-in-law Robert Savile . . . the
said Richard Thymelby, going up to London, negotiated to sell the
property to one Richard Gardiner, and for &pound;2,300 engaged,
at his desire, to convey all to John Wooton, the &pound;2,300 was
paid to Richard Thymelby and bargain settled July 15, 6 Elizabeth
(A.D. 1564). <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; A dispute arose in the following
year between Richard Thymelby and Robert Savile, which was
submitted to arbitrators (Feb. 15, 7 Elizabeth), who ordered
Richard Thymelby to pay Robert Savile &pound;1,500, and Robert
Savile should then convey all to Richard Thymelby.&nbsp; The
&pound;1,500 was paid and afterwards the two &ldquo;confederated
to defraud the said Richard Gardiner and conveyed the said manors
to John Kent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The judgment of the court is not
given, but neither of the defendants, surely, cut a very
creditable figure, and Richard Thymelby, suitably, we must admit,
passes from the scene.</p>
<p>Of the Saviles we may here give a few more particulars.&nbsp;
Gervase Holles, the antiquary, mentions in his <i>Collectanea</i>
(vol. iii, p. 770) John Savile, Esq., as Lord of the Manor of
Tetford, in this neighbourhood, in the reign of Elizabeth, and as
joint Lord of Somersby with Andrew Gedney, Esq. (of the latter
and his wife there is a very fine sepulchral monument in the
church of the adjoining parish of Bag Enderby).&nbsp; The most
distinguished literary member of the family was Sir Henry Savile,
a learned mathematician, Fellow and Warden of Merton College,
Oxford, and Provost of Eton; a munificent patron of <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>learning, founding Professorships of Astronomy and
Geography at his University; he wrote a <i>Treatise on Roman
Warfare</i>, but his great work was a translation of the writings
of St. Chrysostom, a monument of industry and learning; he was
knighted by James I., and his bust is carved in stone in the
quadrangle of the Bodleian Library at Oxford, among those of
other benefactors.&nbsp; Charles I. conferred the Earldom of
Sussex on Thomas, Lord Savile of Pontefract.&nbsp; Several
members of the family were Seneschals, or Stewards, of
Wakefield.&nbsp; George was created Marquis of Halifax, another
was Baron of the Exchequer.&nbsp; The name is given in the
Conqueror&rsquo;s Roll of Battle Abbey (A.D. 1066),
Hollinshed&rsquo;s version, as Sent Ville, in Stow&rsquo;s
version as Sant Vile, while a Chancery Inquisition (of 18 Henry
VII., No. 46, <i>Architectural Society&rsquo;s Journal</i>, 1895,
p. 17) gives it as Say-vile, and on the analogy of Nevill,
formerly de Nov&acirc;-vill&acirc;, we may perhaps assume that
the original form was de Sanct&acirc;-vill&acirc; (or &ldquo;of
the Holy City&rdquo;); which may well have been adopted by one
who had made a pilgrimage to Canterbury, Rome, or Jerusalem
itself.</p>
<p>I should, however, add that a member of the family, Miss
Elizabeth J. Savile, who has herself dug to the roots of the
genealogical tree, gives a different version of their
origin.&nbsp; According to her they are descended from the Dukes
de Savelli, who again trace their lineage from the still more
ancient Sabella in Italy.&nbsp; When John Savile, 2nd son of Sir
John Savile, travelled in Italy in the time of James I., the then
Duke de Savelli received him as a kinsman.&nbsp; Of this family
were the Popes Honorius III. and Honorius IV.&nbsp; A MS.
Visitation in the British Museum says &ldquo;It is conceived,
that this family came into England with Geoffrey Plantagenet,
rather than with the Conqueror, because there are two towns of
this name on the frontiers of Anjou, both of which were annexed
to the crown of England when the said Geoffrey married Maud, sole
daughter and heir of Henry I.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is said to have
been taken from the Savile pedigree in the keeping of Henry
Savile of Bowlings, Esq., living in 1665.&nbsp; The Saviles of
Methley trace their descent, in the male line, from this Sir John
Savile of Savile Hall.&nbsp; One branch, the Saviles of
Thornhill, are now represented in the female line by the Duke of
Devonshire, and the Savile Foljambes, one of whom is the present
Lord Hawkesbury.&nbsp; The Saviles of Copley, now extinct, are
represented by the Duke of Norfolk, and a younger branch by the
Earls of Mexborough.&nbsp; The opinion that they came from Anjou
is generally accepted, the authorities being <i>Yorkshire
Pedigrees</i>, <i>British Museum Visitations</i>, Gregorovius,
uno frio, Panvinio, and other chroniclers.</p>
<p>We now proceed to notice the other persons, of more or less
repute, who were at various periods owners in Horncastle.&nbsp;
In the 3rd year of King John we find Gerard de Camville paying
fees for land in Horncastle by his deputy, Hugo Fitz Richard, to
the amount of &pound;836, which was a large sum in those days. <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; He was sheriff of the county,
A.D. 1190, along with Hugo. <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; The name,
however, is more known for the celebrated defence of Lincoln
Castle by Nicholaia de Camville against the besieging forces of
King Stephen in 1191, and again in her old age against Henry
III., assisted by Louis, Dauphin of France.&nbsp; An ancestor of
William de Camville is named in the Battle Abbey Roll, among
those Normans who came over with the Conqueror.</p>
<p>William de Lizures and Eudo de Bavent are also named as paying
similar fees, though to smaller amounts.&nbsp; The de Lizures
were a powerful Yorkshire <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>family, who
inter-married with the De Lacys of Pontefract Castle and
inherited some of their large estates. <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; Among these, one was the
neighbouring manor of Kirkby-on-Bain, which would seem to have
passed to the Lady Albreda Lizures; <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a> they probably
derived their name from the town of Lisieux, near Harfleur in
Normandy.&nbsp; We soon lose sight of this family in England, and
they seem to have migrated northward and to have acquired lands
in Scotland.&nbsp; The name De Lizures is common in Scottish
Cartularies, for instance in the Cartulary of Kelso, p. 257
(<i>Notes &amp; Queries</i>, series 2, vol. xii, p. 435).&nbsp;
In 1317 William and Gregory de Lizures were Lords of Gorton, and
held lands near Roslyn Castle, Edinburgh (<i>Genealogie of the
Saint Claires of Roslyn</i>, by Father Augustin Hay, re-published
Edinburgh, 1835), [<i>Notes &amp; Queries</i>, 3rd series, vol.
i, p. 173].</p>
<p>The De Bavents were also a distinguished family, their
connection with Horncastle survives in the name of a field in the
south of the parish, on the Rye farm, which is called
&ldquo;Bavent&rsquo;s Close.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few particulars of
this family may not be without interest.&nbsp; The earliest named
are Richard de Bavent in 1160, <a name="citation27c"></a><a
href="#footnote27c" class="citation">[27c]</a> and Eudo de Bavent
in 1161, <a name="citation27d"></a><a href="#footnote27d"
class="citation">[27d]</a> as holding the manor of
Mareham-le-Fen, in the extreme south of the Horncastle soke,
under Henry II., &ldquo;by service of falconry.&rdquo; <a
name="citation27e"></a><a href="#footnote27e"
class="citation">[27e]</a>&nbsp; Eudo (about 1200) gave &ldquo;to
God, the Cathedral, and Chapter of Lincoln,&rdquo; his lands in
the north fen of Bilsby. <a name="citation27f"></a><a
href="#footnote27f" class="citation">[27f]</a>&nbsp; The family
seem to have gradually increased their possessions in this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In 1290, under Edward I., we find Jollan de
Bavent holding lands in Billesby and Winceby, as well as Mareham.
<a name="citation27g"></a><a href="#footnote27g"
class="citation">[27g]</a>&nbsp; In 1319, under Edward II.,
Robert de Bavent holds his land in Billesby of the King by the
service of supplying &ldquo;3 falcons for the royal use,&rdquo;
<a name="citation27h"></a><a href="#footnote27h"
class="citation">[27h]</a> and, under Edward III., certain
trustees of Peter de Bavent, by his will, transfer the manor of
Mareham to the convent of Revesby, to provide a monk who shall
daily throughout the year say masses &ldquo;for the souls of the
said Peter and Catherine, his wife, for ever.&rdquo; <a
name="citation27i"></a><a href="#footnote27i"
class="citation">[27i]</a>&nbsp; Truly &ldquo;L&rsquo; homme
propose, et Dieu dispose,&rdquo; for from this time forward we
hear little of the Bavents.&nbsp; They may &ldquo;call their
lands after their own names,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bavent&rsquo;s
Close&rdquo; survives, but of the whilom owner we can only say,
in the words of Coleridge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The knight&rsquo;s bones are dust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his good sword rust,<br />
His soul is with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The saints, we trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another family of distinction connected with Horncastle was
that of the Angevines.&nbsp; Among the Carlisle documents is one
<a name="citation27j"></a><a href="#footnote27j"
class="citation">[27j]</a> shewing that a trial was held at
Horncastle (A.D. 1489&ndash;90), in which Sir Robert Dymoke,
Knt., and William Angevin, Esq., recovered possession of 400
acres of land, with tofts <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and
appurtenances, in Horncastle and its soke, from John Hodgisson
and his wife, John Cracroft, Gervase Clifton (of Clifton) and
others.&nbsp; This family probably acquired their name thus:
William the Conqueror brought to England from Normandy a body of
troops called the &ldquo;Angevine auxiliaries&rdquo; (from the
province of Anjou), and their descendants were granted lands in
various parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; One family especially seems
to have adopted this name, which was variously spelt as Angevine,
Aungelyne, Aungeby, &amp;c.; they settled in various parts of
this county at an early period, and Horncastle being a royal
manor they naturally were located in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; We
find traces of them at Whaplode in the south, Saltfleetby in the
north, and Theddlethorpe midway, in the 12th and 14th centuries.
<a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a>&nbsp; Among Lincoln records is the
will of Robert Angevin, Gent., <a name="citation28b"></a><a
href="#footnote28b" class="citation">[28b]</a> of Langton by
Horncastle, dated 25 April, 1545, in which he requests to be
buried in the Church of St. Margaret (then a much larger edifice
than the present); he leaves to his son land in Hameringham, and
to his widow, for life, and his four daughters, lands in
Burnsall, Hebden, Conyseat and Norton, in the County of
York.&nbsp; His brother, John Angevin, resided at West Ashby,
then a hamlet of Horncastle.&nbsp; William Angevin, Gent., of
Theddlethorpe <a name="citation28c"></a><a href="#footnote28c"
class="citation">[28c]</a> is named in the official list of
Lincolnshire freeholders made in 1561, and the name also appears
in the Visitation of 1562, but all traces of the family disappear
before the time of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>The same Carlisle document <a name="citation28d"></a><a
href="#footnote28d" class="citation">[28d]</a> mentions Thomas
Fitz-William as concerned in the said dispute, as being a
Horncastle proprietor; while, further, another Carlisle document
of the time of Henry VIII., shows that Thomas Fitz-William, Esq.,
was seized of one capital messuage, 6 other messuages, 4 tofts
and 100 acres of land in Horncastle, held of the Prior of
Carlisle, and John Fitz-William was his heir. <a
name="citation28e"></a><a href="#footnote28e"
class="citation">[28e]</a>&nbsp; The Fitz-Williams again were a
very ancient and distinguished family, the name is found in the
Battle Abbey Roll of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; The family
claim descent from Sir William Fitz-Goderic, cousin of King
Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; His son, Sir William Fitz-William,
has been said (as the name might imply) to have been really a
natural son of William the Conqueror himself, <a
name="citation28f"></a><a href="#footnote28f"
class="citation">[28f]</a> but the more generally accepted
version is that Fitz-Goderic was his father.&nbsp; Sir William
Fitz-William accompanied the Duke of Normandy to England as
Marshal of his army, and for his bravery at the battle of
Hastings the Conqueror gave him a scarf from his own arm.&nbsp; A
descendant, in the reign of Elizabeth, was thrice Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland; he was also Governor of Fotheringhay Castle when the
unfortunate Queen Mary of Scotland was imprisoned there, and
before she was beheaded she gave him a portrait of herself, which
is still preserved at Milton House, near Peterborough, one of the
seats of the Earls Fitz-William, who now represent the family,
Baron of Milton being their second title.&nbsp; A Patent of
Edward IV. (A.D. 1461) <a name="citation28g"></a><a
href="#footnote28g" class="citation">[28g]</a> shows that Richard
Fitz-William had the privilege granted to him by that King of
&ldquo;free warren&rdquo; at Ulceby, near Alford.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>An Inquisition in the reign of Henry VII. <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> (A.D. 1502) shows that Thomas
Fitz-William held the manors of Mavis Enderby, Maidenwell and
Mablethorpe.&nbsp; The list of magistrates for the county in the
reign of Henry VIII. <a name="citation29b"></a><a
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a> contains the name
of George Fitz-William along with Lionel Dymoke, Lord Willoughby,
and others; while an Inquisition held five years later <a
name="citation29c"></a><a href="#footnote29c"
class="citation">[29c]</a> shews that Thomas Fitz-William held
the aforementioned manor of Ulceby, by the &ldquo;service of 1
falcon annually to the King.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir William
Fitz-William in the same reign <a name="citation29d"></a><a
href="#footnote29d" class="citation">[29d]</a> was Lord High
Admiral.&nbsp; John Fitz-William is named in the Herald&rsquo;s
list of county gentry in the 16th century as residing at
Skidbrook, a hamlet of Saltfleet Haven, <a
name="citation29e"></a><a href="#footnote29e"
class="citation">[29e]</a> and William Fitz-William, Esq.,
supplied &ldquo;one lance and two light horse&rdquo; when the
Spanish Armada was expected to invade England, in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. <a name="citation29f"></a><a href="#footnote29f"
class="citation">[29f]</a>&nbsp; William Fitz-William of
Mablethorpe <a name="citation29g"></a><a href="#footnote29g"
class="citation">[29g]</a> married, in 1536, Elizabeth daughter
of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, of Kettlethorpe, a member of a very old
Lincolnshire family, still owning property in this neighbourhood;
and in 1644 Sir William Wentworth, <a name="citation29h"></a><a
href="#footnote29h" class="citation">[29h]</a> a scion of a
younger branch, married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Thomas
Savile, of Wakefield, whose family we have already mentioned as
connected with Horncastle.</p>
<p>In 1620 the head of the Fitz-William family was created an
Irish Peer; in 1742 the 3rd Baron was made Baron Milton in the
peerage of Great Britain; and, 4 years later, Earl
Fitz-William.&nbsp; In 1782, on the death of his uncle, the last
Marquis of Rockingham, the Earl of that day succeeded to the
Yorkshire and Northamptonshire estates of the Wentworths, and in
1807 they took the name of Wentworth as an affix.&nbsp; In the
early part of the 19th century the name became again connected
with Horncastle, when Earl Fitz-William, grandfather of the
present Earl, hunted the local pack of foxhounds, which were kept
in Horncastle, in what is still called Dog-kennel Yard, at the
back of St. Lawrence Street.&nbsp; An old friend, formerly
practicing as a Doctor in Horncastle, but lately deceased, has
told the writer that he remembered seeing the Earl&rsquo;s hounds
breaking cover from Whitehall Wood, in the parish of Martin.</p>
<p>There is one more Carlisle document deserving of quotation as
it is of a peculiar nature.&nbsp; A Patent Roll of the reign of
Elizabeth, <a name="citation29i"></a><a href="#footnote29i"
class="citation">[29i]</a> A.D. 1577, records that a
&ldquo;pardon&rdquo; was granted to &ldquo;Sir Thomas Cecil,
Knt., for acquiring the manor of Langton (by Horncastle) with
appurtenances, and 30 messuages, 20 cottages, 40 tofts, 4
dove-cotes, 40 gardens, 30 orchards, 1,400 acres of (cultivated)
land, 100 acres of wood, 100 acres of furze and heath, 200 acres
of marsh, 40s. of rent, and common pasture, with appurtenances,
in Horncastle, Thimbleby, Martin, Thornton and Woodhall, from
Philip Tylney, Esq., by fine levied without licence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was a somewhat extensive acquisition.&nbsp; We have already
recorded a more than questionable transaction in the transfer of
land by Richard Thymelby and Robert Savile, A.D. 1564, and this
transaction <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>of Sir Thomas Cecil, 13 years later,
seems also to have been in some way irregular, since it needed
the royal &ldquo;pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing to show who this Philip Tylney was, who acted
on this occasion as vendor, but Sir Thomas Cecil was the son of
the great Lord Treasurer Burghley, who was Secretary of State
under Edward VI., and for 40 years guided the Councils of Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; Sir Thomas himself was a high official under
Elizabeth and King James I.; he was knighted in 1575, received
the Order of the Garter in 1601; under James I. he was made Privy
Councillor, and having succeeded his father as Baron Burghley,
was created by James Earl of Exeter.&nbsp; His brother Sir Robert
also held high office and was made in 1603 Baron Cecil, in 1604
Viscount Cranbourne, in 1605 Earl of Salisbury.&nbsp; Thomas
Cecil died Feb. 7, 1622, aged 80, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; He married 1st Dorothy, daughter of John Nevil, Lord
Latimer, and 2nd, Frances, daughter of Lord Chandos.&nbsp; He
was, doubtless, a man of large ideas and great ambition, his
royal mistress was herself Lady of the manor of Horncastle, and
Horncastle having thus been brought under his notice, he may have
been too grasping in compassing his purposes.&nbsp; The Revesby
Charters <a name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> show that he purchased that estate in
1575.</p>
<p>We may add that the Cecils were descended from an ancient
family located in Wales soon after the Norman Conquest, and
acquired large possessions in the reign of King Rufus; the 14th
in descent was David Cecil of Stamford, Sergeant at Arms to King
Henry VIII., he was grandfather to the 1st Lord Burghley. <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a>&nbsp; The present representatives of
this old family are the Marquis of Exeter of Burghley House,
Stamford, and the Marquis of Salisbury of Hatfield House,
Herts.</p>
<p>We have now reached the end of a somewhat lengthy series of
owners formerly connected with Horncastle, its manor, and its
soke, bringing us down to the early part of the 17th century, and
we think that few towns, of its size, could show such a record of
distinguished names.&nbsp; The information available as to more
recent periods is more meagre.&nbsp; The Bishops of Carlisle
continued to hold the manor down to the year 1856, and various
parties held leases of it under them, they themselves residing
here from time to time, <a name="citation30c"></a><a
href="#footnote30c" class="citation">[30c]</a> until the
episcopal palace was demolished in 1770, when the present Manor
House was erected on its site.</p>
<p>We have already stated that Queen Elizabeth leased the manor
from the Bishop of Carlisle of that date, she was succeeded in
the lease by King James I., who transferred it to Sir Henry
Clinton, but owing to a legal error in that transaction, it
proved void.&nbsp; One of the said Bishops in the next reign was
Dr. Robert Snowden, whose family were located in this
neighbourhood, his son being Vicar of Horncastle.&nbsp; Abigail
Snowden married Edward, son of Sir Edward Dymoke, Knt., in 1654,
and Jane Snowden married Charles Dymoke, Esq., of Scrivelsby
Court; the former belonged to the, so called, Tetford branch of
the Dymokes, who have of late years also succeeded to the
Scrivelsby property.&nbsp; Bishop Robert Snowden granted a lease
of the Horncastle manor to his kinsman, Rutland Snowden, and his
assignees for three lives; but this <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>would appear
to have been afterwards cancelled, owing to the
&ldquo;delinquency&rdquo; of the first grantee. <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a>&nbsp; The name of this Rutland Snowden
appears in the list of Lincolnshire Gentry who were entitled to
bear arms, at the Herald&rsquo;s Visitation of 1634. <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a></p>
<p>A break in the continuity of the sub-tenure of the manor here
occurs, but not of long duration.&nbsp; The family of Banks are
next found holding the lease, under the said bishops; the most
distinguished of them being Sir Joseph Banks, the eminent
naturalist, and patron of science in almost every form; who
visited Newfoundland in pursuit of his favourite study;
accompanied Captain Cook in his voyage to the South Seas; visited
Iceland with Dr. Solander, the pupil of Linn&aelig;us; made large
natural history and antiquarian collections; <a
name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"
class="citation">[31c]</a> became President of the Royal Society;
and was largely instrumental in forming the schemes for the
drainage and inclosure of the fens; and other works of public
utility.&nbsp; His family acquired the Revesby Abbey estates in
1714, and were closely connected with Horncastle for more than a
century, as he died in 1820.</p>
<p>One of his ancestors, also Joseph, was M.P. for Grimsby and
Totnes; another, also Joseph, had a daughter, Eleonora, who
married the Honble. Henry Grenville, and was mother of the
Countess Stanhope.&nbsp; Through this last connection, on the
demise of Sir Joseph, the leased manor passed, as the nearest
male relative, to Col. the Honble. James Hamilton Stanhope, who
served in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo.&nbsp; He died three
years later, in 1823, and was succeeded by the late James Banks
Stanhope, Esq., then a minor, and afterwards M.P. for North
Lincolnshire; who, some years ago, transferred all his manorial
rights to the Right Honble. Edward Stanhope, 2nd son of the 5th
Earl Stanhope, and M.P. for the Horncastle Division.&nbsp; He
died 22 December, 1898, and his widow, the Honble. Mrs. Stanhope
of Revesby Abbey, became Lady of the Manor; this, on her decease
in 1907 reverting to the family of the Earl Stanhope, of
Chevening Park, Sevenoaks, Kent, in the person of his son, the
Honble. Richard Stanhope, now residing at Revesby Abbey.</p>
<p>In 1856 the manoral rights of the Bishops of Carlisle were
transferred to the See of Lincoln, and the Bishop of Lincoln is
now <i>ex officio</i> Patron of the Benefice.&nbsp; The head of
the Stanhope family is still the chief owner of property in
Horncastle; other owners being the Vicar with 92 acres, the
representatives of the late Sigismund Trafford Southwell with 67
acres, representatives of the late W. B. Walter (now Majer
Traves) with 58 acres; while Coningtons, Clitherows, Rev. Richard
Ward, and about 100 other proprietors hold smaller
portions.&nbsp; We have mentioned the influence of Sir Joseph
Banks in the drainage and enclosure of the fens, and on the
completion of that important work in Wildmore Fen, in 1813, some
600 acres were added to the soke of Horncastle, about 80 acres
being assigned to the manor, while the glebe of the Vicar was
increased so that it now comprises 370 acres.</p>
<p>We conclude this chapter with another record of the past,
which should <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>not be omitted.&nbsp; It is somewhat
remarkable that although Horncastle has been connected with so
many personages of distinction as proprietors, and for about 600
years (as already shewn) with royalty itself, as an appanage of
the crown, it has only once been visited by royalty in
person.&nbsp; History tells <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a> that &ldquo;on
Sep. 12, 1406, Henry IV. made a royal procession&rdquo; from this
town (probably coming hither from Bolingbroke Castle, his
birthplace), &ldquo;with a great and honourable company, to the
Abbey of Bardney, where the Abbot and monks came out, in
ecclesiastical state, to meet him,&rdquo; and he was royally
entertained by them.&nbsp; We may perhaps assume that as his
father, John of Gaunt, had a palace at Lincoln, <a
name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a> he was on his way thither, where also
his half brother, Henry Beaufort, had been Bishop, but was
promoted two years before this to the See of Winchester.</p>
<p>The nearest approach to another royal visit was that of the
Protector, Oliver Cromwell, which however was of a private
character.&nbsp; Although historians do not generally relate it,
it is locally understood that, after the Battle of Winceby, on
Oct. 11, 1643, Cromwell personally came to Horncastle to see that
proper honours were paid, by the churchwarden, Mr. Hamerton, to
the body of Sir Ingram Hopton, slain on that eventful day in
single combat with Cromwell himself, who pronounced him to be
&ldquo;a brave gentleman,&rdquo; he having, indeed, first
unhorsed Cromwell.&nbsp; This visit would seem to be further
proved by the fact that a man, named John Barber, died in
Horncastle, aged 95, A.D. 1855 (or 1856), whose grandfather
remembered Cromwell, on that occasion, sleeping in the house now
called Cromwell House, in West Street (or rather an older house
on the same site); while in the parish register of West Barkwith
there is an entry of the burial of Nicholas Vickers, in 1719,
with the additional note that he &ldquo;guided Cromwell over
Market Rasen Moor,&rdquo; in his journey northward after the
battle.&nbsp; He may well, therefore, have taken Horncastle on
his way.</p>

33</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>Having, so far, dealt with the more or less conjectural,
prehistoric period of Horncastle&rsquo;s existence in Chapter I,
and with the Manor and its ownership in Chapter II, we now
proceed to give an account of the town&rsquo;s institutions, its
buildings, and so forth.&nbsp; Among these the Parish Church,
naturally, claims precedence.</p>
<h3>ST.&nbsp; MARY&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>This is probably not the original parish church.&nbsp; There
is no mention of a church in <i>Domesday Book</i>, and although
this is not quite conclusive evidence, it is likely that no
church existed at that date (circa 1085 A.D.); but in Testa de
Nevill (temp. Richard I.) we find &ldquo;Ecclesia de
Horncastre,&rdquo; named with those of (West) Ashby, High
Toynton, Mareham (-on-the-Hill), and (Wood) Enderby, as being in
the gift of the King; <a name="citation33a"></a><a
href="#footnote33a" class="citation">[33a]</a> while at an
Inquisition post mortem, taken at Horncastle, 8 Richard II., No.
99, <a name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a> the Jurors say that &ldquo;the Lord
King Edward (I.), son of King Henry (III.), gave to Gilbert,
Prior of the alien Priory of Wyllesforth, and his successors, 2
messuages, and 6 oxgangs (90 acres) of land, and the site of the
Chapel of St. Laurence, with the appurtenances, in
Horncastre,&rdquo; on condition that they find a fit chaplain to
celebrate mass in the said chapel three days in every week
&ldquo;for the souls of the progenitors of the said King, and his
successors, for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; This chapel probably stood
near the street running northwards from the Market Place, now
called St. Lawrence Street, though, a few years ago, it was
commonly called &ldquo;Pudding Lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is said to
have formerly been a main street and at the head of it stood the
Market Cross.&nbsp; Bodies have at various times been <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>found
interred near this street, indicating the vicinity of a place of
worship, and, when a block of houses were removed in 1892, by the
Right Honble. E. Stanhope, Lord of the Manor, to enlarge the
Market Place, several fragments of Norman pillars were found,
which, doubtless, once belonged to the Norman Chapel of St.
Lawrence. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"

<p>The date of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, as indicated by the
oldest part of it, the lower portion of the tower, is early in
the 13th century.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a good example of a town
church of the second class (as said the late Precentor Venables,
who was a good judge) in no way, indeed, rivalling such churches
as those of Boston, Louth, Spalding or Grantham; nay even many a
Lincolnshire village has a finer edifice, but the general effect,
after various improvements, is, to say the least, pleasing, and
it has its interesting features.&nbsp; The plan of the church (he
says) is normal; it consists of nave, with north and south
aisles; chancel, with south aisle and north chantry, the modern
vestry being eastward of this; a plain low tower, crowned with
wooden spirelet and covered with lead.&nbsp; Taking these in
detail: the tower has two lancet windows in the lower part of the
west wall, above these a small debased window, and again, above
this, a two-light window of the Decorated style, similar windows
on the north and south sides, and at the top an embattled
Perpendicular parapet.&nbsp; The tower opens on the nave with a
lofty arch, having pilaster buttresses, which terminate above the
uppermost of two strings; the base is raised above the nave by
three steps, the font being on a projection of the first
step.&nbsp; This lower portion of the tower is the oldest part of
the church, dating from the Early English period.&nbsp; The
chamber where the bells are hung is, by the modern arrangement,
above this lower compartment, and is approached by a winding
staircase built on the outside of the southern wall, a slight
disfigurement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are six bells, with the following
inscriptions:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Lectum fuge.&nbsp; Discute somnum.&nbsp; G. S. T. W.
H. Penn, Fusor, 1717.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; In templo venerare Deum.&nbsp; H. Penn nos
fudit.&nbsp; Cornucastri.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; Supplicem Deus audit.&nbsp; Daniel Hedderley cast
me.&nbsp; 1727.</p>
<p>(4) Tho. Osborn fecit.&nbsp; Downham, Norfolk. 1801.&nbsp;
Tho. Bryan and D. Brown, Churchwardens.</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; Dum spiras, spera.&nbsp; H. Penn, Fusor, 1717.&nbsp;
Tho. et Sam. Hamerton Aeditivi.</p>
<p>(6)&nbsp; Exeat e busto.&nbsp; Auspice Christo.&nbsp; Tho.
Loddington, LL.D., Vicar H P.&nbsp; 1717.</p>
<p>Near the south Priest&rsquo;s door, in the chancel, a bell,
about 1 ft. in height, stands on the floor, unused; this was the
bell of a former clock in the tower.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Pancake
Bell&rdquo; is rung on Shrove Tuesday, at 10 a.m.; the Curfew at
8 p.m., from Oct. 11 to April 6, except Saturdays, at 7 p.m., and
omitting from St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day to Plough Monday.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Grammar School Bell&rdquo; used to be rung daily, Sundays
excepted, at 7 a.m., but of late years this has been
discontinued, the Governors refusing to pay for it.</p>
<p>The fabric of the nave is of the Decorated style, though
modern in date, with Perpendicular clerestory, having five
three-light windows, on the north and south sides.&nbsp; The
arcades are of four bays, with chamfered equilateral arches,
springing from shafted piers; the capitals of the two central
ones being ornamented with foliage of a decorated character; the
others being plain.&nbsp; Each aisle has three three-light
windows, of decorated style, in the side wall, and a fourth at
the west end; these are modern, the north aisle having been <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>re-built in 1820 and the south aisle in 1821.&nbsp;
There are north and south porches.</p>
<p>The chancel arch is modern, the carving of its caps being very
delicate.&nbsp; On the north side the outline of the doorway,
formerly leading to the rood loft, is still visible, and below,
on the west side of the chancel wall, is a well-carved statue
bracket of floriated character, which was transferred from the
chancel, and on the south side a still older one, much
plainer.</p>

<p>The east window of the chancel is said to be an enlarged copy
of the east window of the neighbouring Haltham Church.&nbsp; It
has five lights, with flamboyant tracery above, and is filled
with rich coloured glass, by Heaton, Butler &amp; Bayne; the
subjects being, on the north side, above &ldquo;The
Annunciation,&rdquo; below &ldquo;The Nativity;&rdquo; 2nd light,
above &ldquo;The Adoration,&rdquo; below &ldquo;The Flight into
Egypt;&rdquo; central light, above &ldquo;The Crucifixion,&rdquo;
below &ldquo;The Entombment;&rdquo; next light, on south, above
&ldquo;Women at the Sepulchre;&rdquo; below &ldquo;Feed my
Lambs;&rdquo; southernmost light, above &ldquo;The
Ascension,&rdquo; below &ldquo;Pentecost.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
upper tracery are &ldquo;Censing Angels&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Instruments of the Passion.&rdquo;&nbsp; This window cost
about &pound;280 and is dedicated to the memory of the late
Vicar, Prebendary W. H. Milner, who was largely instrumental in
the restoration of the church, in 1861, and died Oct. 3,
1868.&nbsp; <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>In that restoration the architect was
the late Mr. Ewan Christian, and the contractors for the work
Messrs. Lea &amp; Ashton of Retford.&nbsp; The cost of the
restoration of the chancel was defrayed by J. Banks Stanhope,
Esq., as Lord of the Manor and Lay Rector, the rest being done by
subscriptions amounting to about &pound;4,000.</p>
<p>The present organ was originally designed by Mr. John
Tunstall, and built by Messrs. Gray &amp; Davidson, of London, at
a cost of about &pound;400.&nbsp; As re-constructed by Mr.
Nicholson, of Lincoln, it contains 3 manuals, a fine pedal organ
with 45 stops, and more than 2,500 pipes.&nbsp; It cost more than
&pound;2,000, &pound;1,350 of which was contributed by the late
Henry James Fielding, Esq., of Handel House, Horncastle.&nbsp; At
a later date a trumpet was added, costing &pound;120, the result
being probably as fine an instrument as any in the county.&nbsp;
For many years the organist was Mr. William Wakelin, whose
musical talent was universally acknowledged; on his unfortunate
sudden death, on March 1st, 1908, he was succeeded by Mr. Hughes,
recently Assistant Organist of Ely Cathedral.</p>
<p>Beneath the east window is a handsome carved Reredos of Caen
stone, somewhat heavy in style, having five panels, two on each
side containing figures of the four evangelists, the central
subject being &ldquo;The Agony in the Garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this the figure of the Saviour is exquisitely designed; below are
the three sleeping disciples, while above are two ministering
angels, one holding a crown of thorns, the other the &ldquo;cup
of bitterness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The panels have richly crocketed
canopies, the central one being surmounted by a floriated
cross.&nbsp; They are filled with diaper work, and the supporting
pilasters are of various-coloured Irish marbles.&nbsp; The whole
was designed by C. E. Giles, Esq., cousin of the late Vicar,
Prebendary Robert Giles.</p>
<p>In the jamb, south of the Communion Table, is a Piscina; in
the north wall a square aumbrey and a curious iron-barred
opening, which was probably a Hagioscope for the Chantry
behind.&nbsp; The present Vestry in the north-east corner is
modern, built on the site where there was formerly a coalhouse,
and, at a later date, a shed for the town fire-engine.</p>
<p>The Chancel has an arcade of three bays on the south side,
filled with good 14th century carved oak screen work, separating
it from the south-side chapel, said to have been anciently called
&ldquo;The Corpus Christi Chapel,&rdquo; and has two bays on the
north, the easternmost being occupied by the organ, separating it
from St. Catherine&rsquo;s Chantry; <a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a> the other having
similar screen <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>work.&nbsp; In the south wall of the
chancel are a Priest&rsquo;s door and three four-light
Perpendicular windows, with a fourth in the east wall.&nbsp;
Gervase Holles states that he saw in this south-east window
figures of St. Ninian, with lock and chain, and of Saints
Crispinus and Crispinianus with their shoe-making tools. <a
name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; It is probable, therefore, that
the old glass of the window was supplied by a shoemaker&rsquo;s
guild.&nbsp; The window is now filled with good coloured glass by
Heaton, Butler &amp; Bayne, dedicated to the memory of the late
Vicar, Rev. Arthur Scrivenor, who died 27 August, 1882, aged 51
years.&nbsp; It is of peculiar design, the subjects being chosen
to represent his life of self-denying labour.&nbsp; There are
four lights with eight subjects taken from St. Matthew&rsquo;s
Gospel, arranged in two tiers, as follows&mdash;(1) &ldquo;Come
ye blessed of my Father;&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;I was an hungred and
ye gave me meat;&rdquo; (3) &ldquo;I was thirsty and ye gave me
drink;&rdquo; (4) &ldquo;I was a stranger, and ye took me
in;&rdquo; (5) &ldquo;Naked, and ye clothed me;&rdquo; (6)
&ldquo;I was sick, and ye visited me;&rdquo; (7) &ldquo;I was in
prison, and ye came unto me;&rdquo; (8) &ldquo;These shall go
into life eternal.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are eight compartments in
the upper tracery, containing the emblems of the four
evangelists, and two angels, and the Alpha and Omega.</p>
<p>In the north chancel wall are a Priest&rsquo;s door, two
five-light windows, and one of three lights, with, at the east
end, a two-light window, all modern.&nbsp; Here, externally, the
parapet of St. Catherine&rsquo;s Chantry is embattled and
enriched with panel work, and rises above the level of the rest
of the wall.&nbsp; The clerestory of the chancel has six
three-light windows on the south side, and five on the
north.&nbsp; The easternmost on the north was inserted and made
larger than the others in 1861, and, at a later date, was filled
with good coloured glass by Heaton, Butler &amp; Bayne, as a
public memorial &ldquo;To the glory of God, and in memory of
Barnard James Boulton, M.D., who died March 15 1875.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was an active member of the restoration committee in
1861.&nbsp; The subjects are, in the western light, &ldquo;The
cleansing of the leper&rdquo; in the centre, &ldquo;Letting down
the paralytic through the roof,&rdquo; in the eastern light,
&ldquo;The healing of blind Bartim&aelig;us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the nave the second window from the west end of the south
clerestory is a memorial of the late Mr. W Rayson, builder,
filled with good coloured glass.&nbsp; In the south aisle of the
nave, the easternmost window is a good specimen of coloured glass
by Heaton, Butler &amp; Bayne, erected by public subscription in
January, 1901, &ldquo;To the glory of God, and in grateful
commemoration of the 18 years&rsquo; ministry of Canon E. F.
Quarrington,&rdquo; who resigned the Vicarage in 1900.&nbsp; The
cost of this window was about &pound;80, the subject is
&ldquo;The Sermon on the Mount.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Saviour is
represented as addressing the people, grouped around Him, of all
classes, soldiers, Pharisees, <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>disciples,
travellers, young men, women, and children, with the city in the
background.&nbsp; In the tracery above are angels, with rich ruby
wings, in attitudes of adoration.</p>
<p>The window next to this is filled with coloured glass, by
Clayton &amp; Bell, to the memory of Mrs. Salome Fox.&nbsp; In
the upper tracery are the Alpha and Omega, with the date of
erection &ldquo;Anno Dm&rsquo;ni MDCCCXCVII.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
central light below is the risen Saviour, seated on a throne,
holding the emblem of sovereignty, with the inscription over His
shoulders &ldquo;Because I live ye shall live also.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In each side light are three angels in adoration.&nbsp; An
inscription runs across the three lights, &ldquo;I am he that
liveth and was dead, and, behold, I am alive for
evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beneath are three square compartments,
representing (1) three women, (2) three soldiers, (3) the
apostles SS. John and Peter at the sepulchre, with the
inscription &ldquo;Who shall roll us away the stone from the door
of the sepulchre?&rdquo; and again, below all, &ldquo;To the
glory of God, and in loving memory of Salome Fox, who died June
26, 1883, aged 65.&rdquo;&nbsp; This cost about &pound;85.</p>
<p>The window at the west end of this aisle, by Heaton, Butler
&amp; Bayne, was filled with coloured glass, by the late Mr.
Henry Boulton, in memory of his first wife, being partly paid for
by a surplus of &pound;40 remaining from what was collected for
the chancel east window, and the rest (about &pound;40 more) by
Mr. Boulton himself.&nbsp; The subject is the Saviour&rsquo;s
baptism in the Jordan.</p>
<p>In the north aisle of the nave, the easternmost window was
erected in 1902, at a cost of &pound;98, from a bequest of the
late Mr. Charles Dee, as a memorial of his friend the late Mr.
Robert Clitherow.&nbsp; The subject is &ldquo;The good
Samaritan,&rdquo; who, in the central light, is relieving the
wounded wayfarer; while, in the side lights, the Priest and
Levite are represented as passing him by.&nbsp; In the two upper
quatrefoils are angels holding scrolls, with the inscriptions (1)
&ldquo;Let your light so shine before men,&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;That
they may see your good works.&rdquo;&nbsp; An inscription runs
across the three lights, &ldquo;Blessed is he that provideth for
the sick and needy, the Lord shall deliver him in the time of
trouble;&rdquo; and, below all, &ldquo;To the glory of God, and
in memory of Robert Clitherow, a truly Christian gentleman, by
his faithful servant.&rdquo; <a name="citation38"></a><a
href="#footnote38" class="citation">[38]</a>&nbsp; The artists
were Messrs. Clayton &amp; Bell.</p>
<p>The next window to this, also by Messrs. Clayton &amp; Bell,
is considered the best specimen of coloured glass in the
church.&nbsp; It was erected by public subscription, largely
through the exertions of the late Mrs. Terrot, then of Wispington
Vicarage, near Horncastle, her husband, the Rev. Charles Pratt
Terrot, a clever artist and learned antiquary, supplying the
design.&nbsp; It is inscribed &ldquo;To the glory of God, and in
memory of Frederick Harwood, formerly churchwarden, who died
March 12, 1874, aged 51 years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Harwood was an
indefatigable church worker, and died suddenly, after attending a
Lent service, when he occupied his usual seat, near this
window.&nbsp; It is of three lights, the subjects being six, (1)
the centre light illustrates &ldquo;Charity;&rdquo; a female
figure above, holding one child in her arms and leading others;
while below is &ldquo;Joseph in Egypt, receiving his father,
Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; (2) The west light illustrates
&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; a female above, holding a cross and bible,
and below &ldquo;Abraham offering his son Isaac.&rdquo;&nbsp; (3)
The east light illustrates &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; a female above,
leaning upon an anchor, and below &ldquo;Daniel in the den of
lions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The grouping of the subjects and arrangement
of the canopies are admirable.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>The west window in the same aisle contains a handsome
memorial, by Preedy, of the late Vicar, Prebendary Robert
Giles.&nbsp; It is of three lights, the subjects being from St.
Peter&rsquo;s life: (1) the south light shewing &ldquo;The net
cast into the sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;Depart from me, &amp;c.&rdquo;;
(2) the central light, Peter&rsquo;s commendation by the Saviour,
&ldquo;Thou art Peter, &amp;c.&rdquo;; and (3) the north light,
Peter&rsquo;s release from prison, &ldquo;Arise up quickly,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tabernacle and canopy work are
good.&nbsp; The cost of this was about &pound;140.&nbsp; Mr.
Giles succeeded Prebendary Milner, as Vicar, and died 12 July,
1872.</p>
<p>The two lancet windows in the lower part of the west wall of
the tower, which were enlarged at the restoration, are filled
with good coloured glass.&nbsp; They bear no inscriptions but are
memorials of deceased younger members of the families of the late
Dr. B. J. Boulton, and of the late Mr. Richard Nicholson.&nbsp;
The southern one represents &ldquo;The Good Shepherd,&rdquo;
carrying a lamb in his arms; the northern, &ldquo;Suffer the
little children to come unto me,&rdquo; shewing the Saviour
receiving little children into his arms.&nbsp; Within the tower
is also placed a List of Benefactors of the town; also a frame
containing the Decalogue, supported by two painted figures,
life-size, representing Aaron with his censer, and Moses with his
rod; on one side of this is the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, on the other
the Apostles&rsquo; Creed. <a name="citation39a"></a><a
href="#footnote39a" class="citation">[39a]</a></p>
<p>The roof of the nave, for some years hidden by a flat
whitewashed ceiling, is of Spanish chestnut, with finely carved
figures of angels, which support the intermediate
principals.&nbsp; In front of the tower arch stands the Font, of
caen stone, on octagonal base; the bowl has 8 elaborately carved
panels, in three of which are engraved, on scrolls, the words
&ldquo;One Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;One Faith,&rdquo; &ldquo;One
Baptism.&rdquo; <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a>&nbsp; The Pulpit, at the north-east
corner of the nave, is also of Caen stone, in similar style, with
four decorated panels, having, beneath the cornice, the
inscription &ldquo;He that hath my word, let him speak my word
faithfully;&rdquo; the book-rest is supported by the figure of an
angel, with outspread wings.&nbsp; The Reading Desk, on the
opposite side, consists of open tracery work, carved in modern
oak.&nbsp; The Lectern, an eagle of brass, was presented, in
1901, by the Misses Walter, in memory of their father, Mr. Joseph
Walter, for many years church warden. <a
name="citation39c"></a><a href="#footnote39c"
class="citation">[39c]</a>&nbsp; The seats in the chancel have
handsomely carved poppy heads, and are placed east and west,
instead of, as formerly, north and south, facing west.</p>
<p>On the south side of the chancel arch, in the west face of the
wall, is a small stone, bearing the names of &ldquo;Thomas
Gibson, Vicar.&nbsp; John Hamerton and John Goake, Churchwardens,
1675.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the south wall of the chancel south chapel
is also an illuminated sheet of iron bearing the following
inscription to the same Vicar:&mdash;&ldquo;Sacred to the memory
of the Rev. Mr. Thos. Gibson, A.M., 44 years Vicar of this
parish.&nbsp; He lived in such times when Truth to the Church,
and Loyalty to the King met with punishment due to the worst of
crimes.&nbsp; He was by the rebellious powers carried away
prisoner <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>four times from the garrison of
Newark for a dissenting teacher, afterwards sequestrated, and his
family driven out, by the Earl of Manchester.&nbsp; He survived
the Restoration, and was brought back at the head of several
hundreds of his friends, and made a Prebendary in the Cathedral
Church of Lincoln.&nbsp; As his enemies never forgave his zeal to
the Church and Crown, so nothing but the height of Christian
charity could forgive the insults he met with from them.&nbsp; He
died April 22, 1678.&rdquo; <a name="citation40a"></a><a
href="#footnote40a" class="citation">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Above this
is a shield, containing three storks, proper, on an argent field;
and with a stork, as crest.</p>
<p>On the north clerestory wall of the nave are tablets in memory
of Jane, wife of Thomas Taylor, to the east; in the centre to
Thomas Taylor, Surgeon, and Margaret his wife, to Mary Anne, wife
of Thomas Hardy Taylor; and to the west of these, to Anne, wife
of Erasmus Middleton, to Erasmus Middleton, and to their
daughter, Grace, wife of James Weir, and to James Weir, who died
Dec. 15, 1822.&nbsp; On the south clerestory wall, westward, is a
tablet to the memory of Thomas Bryan, Hannah his wife, and their
son Edward, all interred at Scrivelsby; another, to the east, is
in memory of Edward Harrison, M.D., his wife, and his brother,
erected by his nephew.</p>
<p>In the north aisle of the chancel is a modern, canvas,
lozenge-shaped, framed copy of an older memorial, formerly
painted on the south wall, on which are depicted the arms of Sir
Ingram Hopton, with this inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Here lieth the
worthy and memorable Knight, Sir Ingram Hopton, who paid his debt
to nature, and duty to his King and country, in the attempt of
seizing the arch rebel (Cromwell) in the bloody skirmish near
Winceby, Oct. 6, 1643.&rdquo; <a name="citation40b"></a><a
href="#footnote40b" class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; The motto is
Horatian (the first lines from Odes iii., xiv., 14&ndash;16; the
other two from Odes iv., ix., 29&ndash;30).</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nec

are a number of scythes, some with straight wooden handles,
attached to the wall, which are said to have been used at the
Winceby fight. <a name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"
class="citation">[41a]</a></p>
<p>On the wall of the north aisle, nearest the archway into the
chancel, on a small slab of Purbeck marble, is a brass of Sir
Lionel Dymoke, kneeling on a cushion; on either side were
formerly small shields displaying the arms of Dymoke, Waterton,
Marmyon, Hebden and Haydon; <a name="citation41b"></a><a
href="#footnote41b" class="citation">[41b]</a> and on small
brasses were the figures of two sons and three daughters.&nbsp;
Parts of these are now lost.&nbsp; The figure of Sir Lionel is in
the attitude of prayer, from his left elbow issues a scroll with
the inscription &ldquo;S&rsquo;cta Trinitas, unus Deus, miserere
nob.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beneath is another inscription, &ldquo;In
Honore s&rsquo;cte et individue trinitatis.&nbsp; Orate pro

brass, now mutilated, of the same Sir Lionel Dymoke, wrapped in a
shroud, with two scrolls issuing from the head, the lettering of
which is now effaced.&nbsp; Beneath is an inscription also now
obliterated, but which Mr. Weir gives as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span

<p>The actual suit of armour worn by this Sir Lionel Dymoke was
formerly in the church, since in the evidence taken after the
&ldquo;Lincolnshire Rising,&rdquo; in 1536, it was shewn that
&ldquo;one Philip Trotter, of Horncastle,&rdquo; took it from the
church, and himself wore it, while carrying the standard at the
head of the insurgents (State Papers Domestic, Henry VIII., vol.

surviving child of Richard Kelham, Rector of Coningsby.&nbsp; She
was pious, virtuous, and charitable, and died 26 Feb., 1780, aged
58.&nbsp; Reader, imitate her example.&nbsp; Erected by Robert
Kelham, her nephew, as a grateful acknowledgment of her regard
towards him.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the north wall of the chancel is a
marble tablet in memory of &ldquo;George Heald, Armiger, e
Consultis Domini Regis, in Curi&acirc; Cancellari&acirc;.&nbsp;
Obiit 18 May, 1834.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inscriptions below are to his
wife and daughter.&nbsp; Another tablet, of black marble, records
the death of Elizabeth, first wife of the Rev. John Fretwell,
Curate, Dec. 4, 1784, and of his son, Matthew Harold, Sept. 11,
1786. <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; Another tablet is in memory of
&ldquo;Clement Madeley, DD., 42 years Vicar, who died
Good-Friday, 1845, aged 73;&rdquo; also of his wife Martha, who
died 1807, and of his son Houghton, who died 1838, erected by his
daughter, M. A. Dymoke, <a name="citation44b"></a><a
href="#footnote44b" class="citation">[44b]</a> wife of Rev. John
Dymoke, Champion.</p>
<p>In a glass covered case in the north aisle of the chancel are
three volumes of Foxe&rsquo;s <i>Book of Martyrs</i>, 1632
edition, these were formerly chained to a desk, and parts of the
chains remain.&nbsp; They were given by Nicolas Shipley,
gentleman, in 1696, who also presented a brass chandelier of 24
sockets; he was among the benefactors to the poor of the
town.&nbsp; The present glass case and desk on which the case
rests, were given by the late Vicar, the Rev. A. Scrivenor.&nbsp;
Along with these vols. are &ldquo;The History of the Old and New
Testaments, gathered out of sacred scripture and writings of the
fathers, a translation from the work of the Sieur de Royaumont,
by several hands.&nbsp; London, printed for R. Blome, I. Sprint,
John Nicholson and John Pero, 1701.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are some
good old engravings of &ldquo;The Work of Creation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Temptation and Fall of Man,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Expulsion from Paradise,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Murder of Abel,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ishmael Banished,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; The first of these
is dedicated to &ldquo;Her sacred Majesty, Mary, by the grace of
God, Queen of England, Scotland, France, Ireland, &amp;c., by Her
Majesty&rsquo;s most obedient servant Richard Blome.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The next is dedicated to &ldquo;Her sacred Majesty Katherine,
Queen Dowager of England,&rdquo; by the same; another is
dedicated to &ldquo;Her Royal Highness Ann, Princess of
Denmark;&rdquo; and other plates are dedicated to various
Lincolnshire worthies, some of these are rather damaged, and the
fine old bible is imperfect.</p>
<p>Various old documents may here be quoted, which give items of
interest connected with this church.&nbsp; In <i>Lincolnshire
Wills</i>, 1st series, edited by Canon A. R. Maddison, F.S.A.,
1888, is that of James Burton of Horncastle, of date 9 June,
1536, which mentions the lights burnt in the church at that time
before different shrines; these were in all 23, of which 7 were
in honour of the blessed virgin, one was called &ldquo;The light
of our Lady of Grace,&rdquo; another <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>&ldquo;Our
Lady&rsquo;s light at the font.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mention is also made
of a &ldquo;St. Trunyan&rsquo;s light;&rdquo; this last saint is
connected with a well at Barton-on-Humber, but nothing further is
known of him under that name.&nbsp; It has been suggested that it
is a corruption of St. Ninian (<i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>,
vol. i, 149), and in connection with this it is interesting to
refer to the fact that Gervase Holles, whose description of
Horncastle windows we have already quoted, states that there was
a window to St. Ninian placed in the chancel south aisle, by the
Guild of Shoemakers.&nbsp; Here, then, it is possible, the
&ldquo;St. Trunion&rsquo;s&rdquo; or St. Ninian&rsquo;s
&ldquo;light&rdquo; may have been burned, as the emblem of some
whilom Horncastrian&rsquo;s faith.</p>
<p>A Chancery Inquisition post mortem, 19 Richard II., No. 83 (11
Dec., 1395), shows that Albinus de Enderby and others assigned a
messuage, with appurtenances, in Horncastle, to pay a chaplain to
say daily masses in the church of the blessed Mary, for the soul
of Simon de Dowode, and other faithful deceased.&nbsp; Wood
Enderby was at that time a chapelry attached to Horncastle
Church.</p>
<p>The right of sanctuary, enjoyed by felons, who sought refuge
in a church, was a very ancient institution, dating from Saxon
times, and only abolished by James I., in 1621, because the great
number of churches in the country rendered it so easy a matter
for highwaymen, then very numerous, to avail themselves of the
privilege, that justice was too often defeated and crime
encouraged.&nbsp; According to custom, if the offender made
confession before a coroner, within 40 days, and took the
prescribed oath at the church door, that he would quit the realm,
his life was spared.&nbsp; A Close Roll, 13 Henry III., Aug. 22,
1229, states that the King, at Windsor, commands the Sheriff of
Lincolnshire (Radulphus filius Reginaldi) to send two coroners to
see that a robber who keeps himself in the church at Horncastle
abjures the kingdom, (<i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>, vol. i,
p. 49).&nbsp; It is a somewhat curious coincidence, that a
similar document, of date 16 Henry III., Aug. 22, 1232, only
three years later, records a similar incident; and the malefactor
is ordered to &ldquo;make the assize, and abjuration of the
kingdom, according to the custom of the land and according to the
liberties granted to Walter, Bishop of Carlisle,&rdquo;
(<i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>, vol. iv, p. 58).&nbsp; We
have the explanation of this later instruction in a Memoranda
Roll of 4 Ed. III., 1330, which states that Henry III. granted,
by charter dated 16th July, in the 15th year of his reign, to
Walter, Bishop of Carlisle, and his successors, that they should
claim &ldquo;all chattels of felons and fugitives within their
manors,&rdquo; the crown giving up all claim to the same in their
favour; and the case is added of Robert Mawe, a fugitive, whose
chattels were demanded by the Bishop, and &pound;34 exacted on
that account &ldquo;from the township of Horncastre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the two cases, above quoted, should have
occurred at the same date, August 22.&nbsp; An explanation of
this has been suggested in the fact that an old calendar shows
that August 22 was a day sacred to St. Zaccheus; and as that
saint set the example of restoring four-fold what he had
unlawfully taken, that day may have been selected for the robber
to surrender his chattels in reparation of his offence.&nbsp; A
not improbable explanation, however, may be found in the fact
that the great August fair, established by Royal Charter, closed
on August 21st, and unruly characters were often left, as dregs
of such gatherings in the place, murders even being not
uncommon.&nbsp; By charter of the same king the Bishop of
Carlisle had power to try felons at Horncastle, and a spot on the
eastern boundary of the parish is still known as <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;Hangman&rsquo;s Corner,&rdquo; where those who
were capitally convicted in his court were executed.</p>
<p>We give elsewhere a list of the Incumbents of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, but we may here refer to probably the most
distinguished of them all.&nbsp; A Patent Roll, of date 11 June,
1344 (18 Edward III.), states that Thomas, Bishop of Lincoln
(N.B.&nbsp; This was Thomas Bec, consecrated July 7, 1342, died
Feb. 1, 1346, buried in the north transept of the Cathedral),
&ldquo;by command of the Most Holy Father, Pope Clement VI.,
reduces the taxation of the church at Horncastle, with the
chapels of Askeby (West Ashby), Upper Tynton (High Toynton),
Maring (Mareham-on-the-Hill), and Wod Enderby, to the same church
annexed, to the sum of 50 marks (&pound;33 6s. 8d.), which were
previously taxed at the immoderate sum of &pound;77
sterling.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is stated to be done &ldquo;of the
sincere love with which we value our very dear clerk, Master
Simon de Islep, parson of the church aforesaid.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is also confirmed to &ldquo;his successors, parsons or rectors,
of the said church.&nbsp; Witness the King, at
Westminster.&rdquo;&nbsp; The merits of this worthy, so valued by
the Holy Father, not long afterwards received further
recognition, since in 1350, only 6 years later, he was promoted
to the highest dignity in the land, next to the sovereign
himself, as Archbishop of Canterbury. <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; An earlier
Rector, John de Langton, had been made Bishop of Chichester, A.D.
1305.&nbsp; These are the only incumbents of Horncastle who have
attained the Episcopal Bench, (<i>Horncastle Register Book</i>,
edited by Canon J. Clare Hudson, 1892).</p>
<p>The promotion of the Rector, Simon de Islep, led to more than
one lawsuit.&nbsp; The Bishop of Carlisle, being at that time
heavily in debt, as Lord of the manor, to which, as has already
been stated, the advowson of the church of St. Mary was attached,
had in January, 1347&ndash;8 granted the manor to Hugh de Bole,
and others, on their annual payment of &pound;129 19s.
2&frac12;d, for three years.&nbsp; On the vacancy thus occurring
the Bishop was summoned to appear at Westminster, before Justice
John de Stonor, and others, to answer to William Widuking, of
Saundeby, executor of the will of the said Hugh de Bole, who
claimed, as tenant of the manor, the right to nominate to the
vacant benefice.&nbsp; The Bishop resisted this claim, and the
case was argued before the King&rsquo;s Bench, in Hilary term,
1350, when the Bishop was defeated, the claim of William Widuking
being allowed.&nbsp; (County Placita, Lincoln, No. 46.&nbsp;
Pleas at Westminster, 24 Ed. III., roll 104.)</p>
<p>Seventeen years later, on the death of John de Kirkby, Bishop
of Carlisle, who had presented Simon de Islep to Horncastle, the
temporalities of the bishopric for the time lapsed to the King;
and Thomas de Appleby, the succeeding Bishop, with John de
Rouceby, clerk (who afterwards became Rector of Horncastle), were
summoned to answer to the King, that the King be allowed, through
the said lapse, to appoint to the vacant Benefice of St.
Mary.&nbsp; The Bishop and John de Rouceby brought the case
before the court, but they admitted the justice of the
King&rsquo;s plea, and judgment was given for the King.&nbsp; (De
Banco Roll, 41 Ed. III., in. 621.)&nbsp; Apparently, as a
compromise, the King appointed John de Rouceby.&nbsp; This John
de Rouceby, while Rector of Horncastle, was murdered on the high
road to Lincoln in 1388, (<i>Horncastle Register Book</i>, p.
2).</p>
<p>We may here observe, that in the above documents, the
Incumbent of <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>St. Mary&rsquo;s Church is styled
&ldquo;Parson&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rector,&rdquo; not, as he is at
the present day, &ldquo;Vicar.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this change of
status we are able to give the following particulars.&nbsp; Among
the Bishop &ldquo;Nicholson MSS.,&rdquo; which are in the custody
of the Dean and Chapter of Carlisle, and consist of extracts from
the old &ldquo;Bishops&rsquo; Registers,&rdquo; it is stated
(vol. iv, p. 349) that Bishop Stern of Carlisle, under agreement
with the Bishop of Lincoln (Dr. Robert Sanderson) in 1660,
appropriated the Rectorial appurtenances of the Benefice of St.
Mary to the See of Carlisle.&nbsp; This, however, would seem to
be only a confirmation, or renewal, of what had been done long
before, since as far back as 1313, the Bishop of Carlisle
petitioned the Pope, to allow the church revenues of St. Mary,
Horncastle, to be appropriated to that See, which had been
&ldquo;wasted by war and other calamities;&rdquo; the Rector of
the day only stipulating for a <i>pensio congrua</i> being
reserved to him for his lifetime.&nbsp; (Carlisle Episcopal
Registers, xix, p. 181 b).&nbsp; This was repeated about 1334
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 187, a.&nbsp; Quoted <i>Horncastle Register
Book</i>, p. 2).&nbsp; The title Rector accordingly disappears
and from about 1400 only that of Vicar is used, the Bishops of
Carlisle themselves having become the
&ldquo;Rectors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Early in the 19th century (21 March,
1803) the Bishop of Carlisle leased the manor, with
appurtenances, to Sir Joseph Banks, and his representatives are
now Lay Rectors.</p>
<p>The appointment of one of the early Rectors is a sample of the
abuses connected with Papal supremacy in those times.&nbsp; Peter
de Galicia was nominated Rector in May, 1313, he was a foreigner
and probably drew his income without ever residing at
Horncastle.&nbsp; Having influence at the Papal Curia, he
negociated for the Bishop of Carlisle the transfer of the
Rectorial appurtenances of Horncastle to that See; only, as has
been stated, taking care that he had his own <i>pensio
congrua</i>.&nbsp; Becoming dissatisfied with the benefice he
ultimately exchanged it for the Rectory of Caldbeck in the
diocese of Carlisle.&nbsp; These proceedings are given at length
in Bishop de Kirkby&rsquo;s Register; his Italian name was Piero
de Galiciano.&nbsp; He was succeeded in 1334 by Robert de
Bramley, Rector of Caldbeck.&nbsp; (Carlisle Episcopal Registers,
quoted <i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>, vol. v, pp.
244&ndash;5).</p>
<p>Horncastle was one of the centres of disturbance at the time
of the &ldquo;Lincolnshire Rising&rdquo; (already referred to) or
&ldquo;Pilgrimage of Grace,&rdquo; in 1536, and St. Mary&rsquo;s
Church was the main cause of the local agitation.&nbsp; William
Leche, brother of the parson of Belchford, was a ringleader in
the town.&nbsp; The plundering of churches, by the King&rsquo;s
&ldquo;visitors,&rdquo; for the &ldquo;valor
ecclesiasticus,&rdquo; on the plea of regulating ceremonial, but
more really with a view to replenishing the royal coffers, was
the great grievance with the people.&nbsp; Much evidence on the
subject is found among State Papers Domestic, vol. xi, 28 Henry
VIII.&nbsp; One witness, Edward Richardson of Thimbleby, states
that William Leche, on Tuesday, 2nd Oct., &ldquo;stirred the
people to rise to save the church jewels from the Bishop&rsquo;s
officers,&rdquo; who were acting by the King&rsquo;s orders, the
Bishop being the King&rsquo;s confessor.&nbsp; Robert Sotheby of
Horncastle, being sworn before Sir Anthony Wyngffeld and Sir
Arthur Hopton, says that &ldquo;David Benet, a wever, rang the
comon bell,&rdquo; to rouse the people.&nbsp; The said Robert
stated that he and William Bywater, being churchwardens, were
going to see the work of the plumbers, and in the meantime the
said Davy rang the common bell; and that &ldquo;William Leche was
the first begynner and sterer of the whole rysinge
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mob marched about with a standard,
carried by Philip Trotter, clad in the armour of Lionel Dymoke,
which he had taken <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>from the church of St. Mary.&nbsp;
The devices on the standard were &ldquo;a plough,&rdquo; to
encourage the husbandmen; the &ldquo;challice and Host,&rdquo;
because the church plate and jewellery were to have been taken
away; the &ldquo;wands&rdquo; were to encourage the people
&ldquo;to fight in Cristis cause;&rdquo; the &ldquo;horn&rdquo;
betokening Horncastle.</p>
<p>About 100 persons marched to Scrivelsby, and threatened to
drag out Edward Dymoke, the sheriff, and other gentlemen.&nbsp;
The sheriff, Thomas Dymoke, Robert Dighton, and one Saundon,
afterwards went into the field, and conversed with Leche, who
said the Rising was because the Visitors would take the church
goods.&nbsp; The mob took the old gentleman, Sir William Saundon,
and &ldquo;harried him forth by the arms towards Horncastell,
till from hete and weryness he was almost overcum.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
horse was brought for him by one Salman of Baumbrough, but one of
the rebels strake the horse on the head, so that both horse and
rider fell to the ground, and they then said he must &ldquo;go
afote as they did.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was afterwards confined in the
&ldquo;Moot Hall,&rdquo; at Horncastle, and &ldquo;they sware
him, whether he woll, or no.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many witnesses
testified to the activity of Leche, in going to private houses
and inducing the men to join, and that the gentlemen only joined
from fear of violence.&nbsp; Richard Mekylwhite of Horncastle was
accused by Thomas Lytellbury, that he was &ldquo;a great
procurer&rdquo; (of men), and was &ldquo;one of the causers of
George Wolsey&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; (a servant of the late
Cardinal Wolsey).</p>
<p>William Leche, with a great company, went to Bolingbroke, to
take the Bishop&rsquo;s Chancellor, Dr. John Rayne, who was lying
there, sick; he was brought on horseback to Horncastle amid cries
of &ldquo;kill him! kill him!&rdquo;&nbsp; He begged Philip
Trotter to save him, who said he would do what he could; the
Chancellor gave him xxs., but he in effect did the reverse of
helping him.&nbsp; On reaching the outskirts of the town,
&ldquo;many parsons and vicars among&rdquo; the rebels cried
&ldquo;kill him!&rdquo; whereat William Hutchinson and William
Balderstone, of Horncastle, &ldquo;pulled him viantly of his
horse, kneling upon him, and with their staves slew
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Vicar of Thornton gave xvs. to the
rebels.&nbsp; The Vicar of Horncastle, at that time John
Haveringham, seems to have avoided being mixed up with this
movement, as many of his brethren were.&nbsp; The whole affair
barely lasted a week, and it does not appear that the church
plate suffered.&nbsp; The King issued a proclamation from
Richmond, 2 December following, that he pardoned all except the
wretches in ward at Lincoln, T. Kendal the Vicar of Louth, and
William Leche of Horncastle.</p>
<p>For a final notice of old records connected with the church,
we may mention a matter of less importance, but one which we can
hardly realise, in these days of religious liberty, when everyone
is &ldquo;a law unto himself&rdquo; in matters of faith, and even
largely in practice.&nbsp; The parish book of the adjoining
Thimbleby, which is in the soke of Horncastle, shews that, as
late as the year 1820, the parish officials ordered all paupers,
in receipt of parish relief, to attend the church services, on
pain of forfeiting the aid granted; and cases are named where the
payment was stopped until the offender had given
satisfaction.&nbsp; The State Papers Domestic of 1634 show that,
at Horncastle, there was a like strictness.&nbsp; Luke Burton of
this town was fined 1s. for being &ldquo;absent from divine
service,&rdquo; and again a like sum as &ldquo;absent from
prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even &ldquo;a stranger, a tobacco
man,&rdquo; was fined 1s. for the same offence; and 3s. 4d. for
&ldquo;tippling in time of divine service.&rdquo;&nbsp; John
Berry, butcher, was fined 1s. &ldquo;for swearing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Simon Lawrence, for selling ale contrary to law, was fined 20s.;
the same &ldquo;for permitting tippling, 20s.;&rdquo; while for
&ldquo;selling <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>ale without a licence,&rdquo; William
Grantham and Margaret Wells were &ldquo;punished upon their
bodies.&rdquo;&nbsp; (State Papers Domestic, vol. 272, No. 23,
Chas. I.)</p>

<p>For some of the earlier details I am indebted to the Rev. W.
O. Massingberd.</p>
<p>The Parish Registers of Horncastle are of some interest.&nbsp;
They date from 1559, the year following the
&ldquo;Injunction&rdquo; issued by Queen Elizabeth (the 3rd of
its kind) ordering the regular keeping of such records; similar,
earlier, though less stringent, orders having been made in 1538,
1547 and 1552.&nbsp; Besides the records of baptisms, marriages
and burials, there are occasional notes on peculiar passing
events, which we may here notice.&nbsp; One of these occurs in
1627, &ldquo;Upon Monday, beinge the xxviijth day of January was
a great Tempest of Winde, the like hath not often been in any
age; like wise upon Friday the 4th of November 1636 in the night
time there happened a more fearful (wind than) before.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir, in his <i>History of Horncastle</i>, quotes a note
(folio 42 b of the Register): &ldquo;On the vth daie of October
one thousand six hundred and three, in the ffirst yere of oure
Sov&rsquo;aigne Lord King James was holden in Horncastell Church
a solemnn fast from eight in the morning until fower a clock in
the after noone by five preachers, vidz. Mr. Hollinghedge, Vicar
of Horncastell, Mr. Turner of Edlington, Mr. Downes of Lusbye,
Mr. Philipe of Solmonbye, Mr. Tanzey of Hagworthingha&rsquo;,
occasioned by a generall and most feareful plague yt yere in
sundrie places of this land, but especially upon the Cytie of
London.&nbsp; p&rsquo;r me Clementem Whitelock.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Parish Clerk.)</p>
<p>We may observe that at this time there perished in London more
than 30,000 persons; but the great plague, or &ldquo;black
death,&rdquo; occurred 61 years later (1664&ndash;5), which
carried off from 70,000 to 100,000 persons.&nbsp; Between these
periods, and previously, various parishes in our neighbourhood
suffered from this visitation; for instance at Roughton, which is
in the soke of Horncastle, there were 43 burials, including those
of the Rector and two daughters, in the year 1631&ndash;2; while
in the adjoining parish of Haltham (also in the soke) although
there was no increase of mortality at that date, there had been
51 deaths in the year 1584; there being a note in the register
for that year, &ldquo;This yeare plague in Haltham.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The turn, however, for Horncastle came in the year 1631, when the
register shows that between May 3 and Sep. 29, there were no less
than 176 deaths; in one case 7 in a family (Cocking), 5 in a
family (Halliday), in other cases 4 (Joanes), and again
(Hutchinson) 4, (Fawcitts) 4, (Cheesbrooke) 4, &amp;c.&nbsp; In
August alone there were 86 deaths, and not a single marriage
through all these months, whereas the following year there were
only 25 deaths in the whole twelve months.&nbsp; Truly
Horncastrians were, at that dread time, living with the sword of
Damocles hanging over them.&nbsp; A note in the margin in this
year is as follows, &ldquo;Oct. 5th, buryalls since July 23, 144;
burialls since Easter 182.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have already given the history of the Vicar, Rev. Thos.
Gibson, he is referred to in the two following notes in the
Register.&nbsp; At the end of folio 81a (1635) we find, after the
signature of himself and churchwardens, &ldquo;Thomas Gibson,
Clerk, Master of the free school of Newcastel uppon Tine, one of
the Chapleins of the Right Reverend Father in God Barnabas, by
Divine P&rsquo;vidence Lo. Bpp. Carliel, presented by the said
Lo. Bpp., was inducted into this Vicarage of Horncastel April
xiiij, 1634.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the end of folio 85a (1639) after
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>similar signatures is this: &ldquo;The sd Mr. Thomas
Gibson, being outed of Horncastle by Cromwell&rsquo;s
Commissioners, removed to Nether Toynton, lived there one yeare,
after restored againe, taught some Gentlemen sonnes in his owne
house, was afterward called to ye scole at Newark, where he
continued one yeare, then was importuned to Sleeford, whether he
went ye week after Easter 1650, continued there until May ye
first 1661; then, the King being returned, he returned to his
Vicaridge, and was by Doctor Robert Sanderson, Bishop of Linkcoln
made Preban of Saint Mairie Crakepoule in the Church of
Linkcoln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be observed that the spelling in those times, the
entries doubtless being often made by the parish clerk, was
rather phonetic than orthographic.&nbsp; Many names occur which
still survive, but here spelt variously, for instance Fawssett
has been a name well known in Horncastle in modern times in a
good position, in town and county, here we find it in generation
after generation as Fawcet, Fawset, Faucitt, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
name Raithbeck is of continual occurrence, it is now probably
represented by Raithby.&nbsp; Castledine occurs several times,
being probably the phonetic form of the modern Cheseltine.&nbsp;
The present name Chantry appears as Chauntry.&nbsp; Palfreyman,
or Palfreman, occurs on several occasions, they were of a
respectable family in the county, William Palfreyman being Mayor
of Lincoln in 1534; Ralph Palfreyman, clerk, was presented to the
Benefice of Edlington, by his brother Anthony, merchant of the
Staple, Lincoln, in 1569.</p>
<p>In folio 69a (1628) is the entry &ldquo;Tirwhitt Douglas,
daughter unto Mr. George Tirwhitt, christened Jan.
8.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her father George Tyrwhitt was a scion of the old
county family of the Tyrwhitts of Kettleby, Stainfield, &amp;c.,
by Faith, daughter of Nicholas Cressy of Fulsby, who married
Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Ayscough, of another very old
county family.&nbsp; She was named Douglas, though a female,
after her kinswoman, Douglas, daughter of William, first Lord
Howard of Effingham.&nbsp; Her sister married Sir Edward Dymoke
of Scrivelsby.&nbsp; She herself is mentioned among the
benefactors to the poor of Horncastle, as leaving a charge of
10s. on a farm at Belchford, as an annual payment, on her death
in 1703.</p>
<p>Another name of frequent occurrence, though now extinct, is
that of Hamerton.&nbsp; John Hamerton (as already stated) is
mentioned, with John Goake, on a tablet inserted in the wall on
the south side of the chancel arch, as being churchwarden in the
vicariate of Thomas Gibson, in 1675, and throughout the early
registers successive generations of this family are
recorded.&nbsp; They may have been humble scions of the
Hamertons, of Hamerton, Yorkshire, a branch of whom were among
the landed gentry near the Scottish border; but at Horncastle
they were engaged in trade.&nbsp; John Hamerton, christened Dec.
10, 1575, whose probable father, another John Hamerton, was
buried Sep. 3, 1584, married Feb. 2, 1613, Grace Broxholme, whose
father John Broxholme is described as &ldquo;Gent&rdquo; in
1611.&nbsp; Thomas Hamerton in 1603 was a draper, another Thomas
Hamerton in 1613 was a &ldquo;yoman,&rdquo; John in 1615 was a
tanner, Thomas in 1606 and 1617 was a tanner, Robert son of
Thomas in 1619 was a tanner, William in 1620 was a glover.&nbsp;
In 1630, Thomas, buried Jan. 24, is designated
&ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;&nbsp; On June 16, 1633, Katherine Hamerton is
married &ldquo;by Licence&rdquo; to George Colimbell.&nbsp; A
rise in status is indicated by the two latter entries, and
accordingly, in the records of the neighbouring parish of
Edlington we find &ldquo;Geo. Hamerton, gent., and Sarah Hussey
married July 21, 1699;&rdquo; the Husseys being probably
connected with <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the county family, the head of which
was Lord Hussey of Sleaford.&nbsp; The John Hamerton,
churchwarden in 1675, was born Jan. 22, 1636, son of John and
Dorothy Hamerton.&nbsp; The marriage of the parents is not given
in the register, the father therefore probably married an
&ldquo;outener,&rdquo; as they are provincially termed.&nbsp; The
interesting point however in connection with this family is, that
although they have long ago been extinct, they have left their
mark behind them still surviving in the town.&nbsp; Near the
junction of East Street with South Street there still exists at
the back of the second shop, in the former street (a repository
for fancy needlework), a room lined with good oak wainscoting,
with finely carved mantelpiece, over which is an inscription,
richly carved in relief, with the letters &ldquo;A&deg; Di&rdquo;
to the left, and to the right the date &ldquo;1573;&rdquo; while
above, in the centre, are the initials &ldquo;J H&rdquo; and
&ldquo;M H;&rdquo; separated by a floriated cross and encircled
by a wreath.&nbsp; This would doubtless be John Hamerton and his
wife Mary (or Margaret) Hamerton, the original builders of the
house.&nbsp; Two doors beyond is Hamerton Lane, and the title
deeds, which the present writer has inspected, show that the
whole of this block of buildings now forming five shops and two
private residences, once formed one large dwelling place,
belonging to the Hamerton of that day, with a frontage in East
Street of more than 20 yards, and in South Street of 70 or 80
yards, with extensive back premises and gardens attached.&nbsp;
The J.H. and M.H., of whom we have here such interesting relics,
were probably the grandfather and grandmother of the John
Hamerton of the time of the Commonwealth and Charles II., and the
extent of the buildings occupied by them show that they were
wealthy.</p>
<p>Tanning was at one time the chief trade of the town, there
being within the writer&rsquo;s recollection several tan yards,
now no longer existing.&nbsp; The Bain water was said to be
specially suited for this purpose.&nbsp; We have seen that
several of the Hamertons were tanners, and they had evidently
prospered in their calling.</p>
<p>One more name in the register deserves a brief notice, that of
Snowden (spelt there Snoden).&nbsp; We have, at various dates,
from 22 Oct. 1629, onwards, the baptisms of the whole family of
Mr. Rutland Snowden, and the burials of some of them.&nbsp; The
Snowdens were originally a Notts. family, of the smaller gentry
class, but Robert Snowden, third son of Ralph Snowden, of
Mansfield Woodhouse, became Bishop of Carlisle, and, ex officio,
Lord of the Manor of Horncastle.&nbsp; The Bishops of Carlisle
had, as has been already stated, a residence in Horncastle, near
the present Manor House, and the Bishop&rsquo;s widow, Abigail,
probably resided there.&nbsp; In her will, dated 15 April, 1651,
and proved 7 May in the same year, she mentions her sons Rutland
and Scrope; there was also another son Ralph.&nbsp; Rutland
married on Xmas day, 1628, Frances, widow of George Townshend,
Esq., of Halstead Hall, Stixwould, and Lord of the Manor of
Cranworth, Norfolk, by whom he had a large family.&nbsp; His
granddaughter, Jane Snowden, married Charles Dymoke, Esq., of
Scrivelsby; she died childless and founded and endowed the
village school and almshouses at Hemingby.&nbsp; Another
granddaughter, Abigail, married Edward Dymoke, younger son of Sir
Edward Dymoke, of Scrivelsby, as shewn by the register there, on
18 July, 1654, and she thus became ancestress of the Tetford
branch of the Dymokes, now also of Scrivelsby.</p>
<p>Rutland Snowden, who graduated B.A. at Christ&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, 1617&ndash;8, took his M.A. degree at St. John&rsquo;s
College, Oxford, 1623, and was admitted a member of Gray&rsquo;s
Inn in the same year.&nbsp; He was buried at <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Horncastle,
1654 (<i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>, vol. iv, pp.
14&ndash;16).&nbsp; That was a period of national disturbance,
and the people of Horncastle, with the Winceby fight of 1643,
were more or less drawn into the vortex.&nbsp; Abigail Snowden,
widow of Bishop Robert of Carlisle seems to have been brought
into much trouble, owing to her son, Rutland, having espoused the
Royalist cause.&nbsp; Among Exchequer Bills and Answers (Chas.
I., Lincoln, No. 86) is a petition shewing that Francis, Bishop
of Carlisle, leased to Rutland Snowden and his assignees, for
three lives, the manor, lands, parsonage, and other premises at
Horncastle, on payment of &pound;120.&nbsp; Subsequent
proceedings would seem to imply that this lease was previously
granted to the said Abigail herself, as shewn by the following:
&ldquo;To the Honourable the Commissioners for compounding with
delinquents.&nbsp; The Humble Petition of Abigail Snowden, widow,
sheweth that Richard Milborne, late Bishop of Carlisle, did, 22
Sep., 1623, for valuable consideracions, demise the manor and
soke of Horncastle (parcel of ye lands of ye Bishopricke) unto
your petitonr, during the lives of Rutland Snoden, Scroope
Snoden, and George Snoden, and for the life of the longest of
them; that the said demise being allowed good unto her by the
trustees . . . yet hath bene, and is, sequestrated, for the
delinquensie of the said Rutland Snoden . . . the petitioner
prayeth . . . that your petitioner may have releife . . . as to
you shall seem meet.&nbsp; And yr petitioner will praie,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Abigail Snoden, 24 Nov., 1650.&rdquo;&nbsp; A note
adds that the matter was &ldquo;Referred to Mr. Brereton, to
examine and report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was reported on by Peter Brereton, 31 Jan. following
(Royalist Composition Papers, 1st series, vol. 58, No.
515).&nbsp; As this is a fair sample of the treatment by the
Parliamentary officials of Royalist &ldquo;delinquents&rdquo; and
their friends, we here give further particulars.</p>
<p>A similar petition was presented by &ldquo;John Bysse,
gent.&rdquo; (given in Royalist Composition Papers, 1st series,
vol. 8, No. 167).&nbsp; Further, Abigail Snowden bequeathed her
interest in the above lease to Thos. Toking, who was of Bucknall
and of Ludgate Hill, London.&nbsp; Accordingly, two years later,
we have another attempt at recovery, as follows: &ldquo;To the
Honourable Commissioners for compounding with Delinquents.&nbsp;
The humble petition of Thomas Toking, of Co. Lincoln, gent.,
sheweth, that a lease was made to him by Abigail Snowden, widow,
deceased, of the manor, &amp;c., &amp;c., which had been
sequestered many years, for the delinquency of Rutland Snowden .
. . and that he (T. Toking) has more to offer, for the clearing
of his title.&nbsp; He prays therefore for a commission of
enquiry.&nbsp; 21 Oct., 1652.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reply: &ldquo;not
sufficient proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The said Thos. Toking again petitions, stating, that he is
willing, to avoid further trouble, to submit to &ldquo;a
reasonable composition.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is again
&ldquo;referred to Mr. Brereton,&rdquo; 7 Feb., 1653.&nbsp; On 21
Sep., 1653, the order was issued that &ldquo;the Petitioner be
admitted for compounding.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again &ldquo;Referred to
Mr. Brereton.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result, however, was that Mr.
Thomas Toking died before obtaining the &ldquo;relief&rdquo;
petitioned for.</p>
<p>N.B.&nbsp; Besides the &ldquo;delinquency&rdquo; of having
&ldquo;adhered to, and assisted, ye forces against the
Parliament,&rdquo; it was charged against Rutland Snowden that he
had &ldquo;more wives than one.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;rendered
his estate in fee&rdquo; at Horncastle, in Nov., 1645, for which
his fine, at one-tenth was &pound;188 (Royalist Composition
Papers, 1st series, fol. 113).&nbsp; His son, a second Rutland
Snowden, was among the Benefactors of Horncastle, as he
bequeathed to the poor of the town, 1682, &ldquo;one house of the
yearly rent of 26s.,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;paid in bread, 6d. <!--
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>every other Sunday;&rdquo; a considerably larger sum at
that time than now.</p>
<p>We find the names of Rutland Snoden of Horncastle, and Scrope
Snoden of Boston, in the list of Lincolnshire Gentry, entitled to
bear arms, made by the Heralds, at their Visitation in 1634;
along with other well known names in the neighbourhood, such as
Dymoke, Heneage, Laugton, Massingberd, Tyrwhitt, &amp;c.
(<i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>, vol. i, p. 106).&nbsp; The
Snowden arms are said, in Yorke&rsquo;s <i>Union of Honour</i>,
to have been &ldquo;Azure a lion rampant, or.&rdquo; (<i>Lincs.

</a></p>
<p>The Vicarage of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church formerly stood at the
north-east corner of the churchyard, forming part of a block of
small houses.&nbsp; It was a poor residence, but occupied until
his death in 1845, by the Vicar, Clement Madely, DD.&nbsp; The
whole block was, about that time, taken down, the space being,
later on, covered with the present substantial buildings.&nbsp;
His successor, Rev. T. J. Clarke, rented a good house in South
Street, now occupied by Mrs. Howland.&nbsp; Mr. Clarke was
succeeded by the Rev. W. Holme Milner, in 1853, and he built the
present vicarage.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s Churchyard was closed, for burials, in 1848,
when the churchyard of Holy Trinity was consecrated.</p>

<p>Those marked with asterisk are used at Holy Trinity
Church.</p>
<p>We cannot here omit our tribute to the energy, liberality, and
taste of the various parties connected with the restoration of
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, begun in 1859, and happily completed in
April, 1861.&nbsp; With a persevering vicar, in Prebendary W. H.
Milner, undaunted by difficulties, to head the movement; a
working committee, no less resolute, to support him (among whom
figured foremost the late Dr. J. B. Boulton and Mr. F. Harwood);
with an architect of cultivated taste and wide experience, in Mr.
Ewan Christian; and with the able contractors, Messrs. Lee &amp;
Ashton, to carry out his designs; and with a body of subscribers,
headed by the Lord of the Manor, J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., all
doing their best; the work was bound to be a marked success, of
which all might be proud.&nbsp; St Mary&rsquo;s now probably
approaches nearer to its original conception (if it does not,
indeed, surpass it) than it has ever done in recent times.&nbsp;
Erected, as it first was, in an age marked by &ldquo;zeal&rdquo;
for church construction, even if sometimes &ldquo;without
knowledge;&rdquo; stimulated, perhaps in an unwholesome degree,
by the prevalent superstition and mariolatry, we yet feel bound,
considering the noble structures which those builders have
transmitted to us, (as Prior the poet says) to be &ldquo;To their
virtues very kind, and to their faults a little
blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, as to the restoration in the present
instance, few, save the older ones among us, who remember the
condition into which the fabric had lapsed, can realise the great
changes which were effected, or the advantages secured to present
worshippers.&nbsp; The space formerly wasted by a western
vestibule, with its boarded partition, and baize-covered doors,
leading into nave and aisles, reducing by several feet the length
of sitting space; the basement of the tower shut off, and
occupied only by the bell ringers, who are now removed to the
chamber above; the chancel aisles unused for seats and partially
blocked up; the high square pews, rising in tiers westwards,
roomy enough for undisturbed slumber; above all, the heavy
galleries, with pews, made by faculty private property; all these
arrangements so curtailed the accommodation, that the
congregation, at its best, could be little more than half what it
has been in recent years; while the <i>tout ensemble</i>, not
omitting the flat whitewashed ceiling, put up, it has been said,
by a kind lady, because the vicar, sensitive to cold, felt the
draughts through the fine wooden roof thus hidden above, had an
effect the very opposite of stimulating devotion, bad alike for
minister and people.&nbsp; Under the restored condition, with
sixty additional seats provided in the tower, the south chancel
aisle also seated, and every available space utilized, there is
now ample accommodation for some 800 worshippers, and on special
occasions more than 1,200 have been seated (the late Mr. W. Pacy
counted about 1,250 passing out at the evening service at the
re-opening in April, 1861); while the services, and the
surroundings, are alike calculated to inspire feelings of
reverence, with hearty earnestness of worship; this is the result
mainly due to the &ldquo;decency and order&rdquo; effected
through the care and self-denying efforts of the restorers, for
which all should be grateful.</p>
<p>We should here add that in the year 1892, it being found that
decay had occurred in the walls and other parts of the church,
about &pound;150 was raised by subscription, and once more the
fabric was put into a complete state of repair.</p>
<h2><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
THE CHURCH OF HOLY TRINITY</h2>
<p>Was built in the years 1847 and 1848, as a Chapel of Ease to
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, in the vicariate of the Rev. T. J.
Clarke, at a cost of about &pound;2,500; &pound;500 having been
bequeathed towards that purpose by his predecessor, Dr. Clement
Madely, and the rest being raised by public subscriptions.&nbsp;
The foundation stone was laid April 6, in the former year, by Sir
Henry Dymoke, Bart., the Queen&rsquo;s Champion.&nbsp; The roof
of the nave was reared Oct. 12, and the cross on the east end of
the chancel erected Nov. 25, in the same year.&nbsp; The church
and churchyard were consecrated by Dr. Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln,
April 27, 1848; his Lordship preaching at the opening service in
the morning, and Dr. Percy, Bishop of Carlisle (as Patron <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a> of the Benefice) in the
afternoon.&nbsp; The architect was Mr. Stephen Lewin, of Boston
(author of <i>Churches of the Division of Holland</i>, 1843,
&amp;c) Mr. Hind, of Sleaford, being the contractor for the
work.</p>
<p>It was a condition of Dr. Madely&rsquo;s bequest that the
church should be commenced within two years of his death, which
occurred on Good Friday, March 21, 1845.&nbsp; This fortunately
was just (but only just) effected <a name="citation57b"></a><a
href="#footnote57b" class="citation">[57b]</a> in time to secure
the bequest.</p>
<p>When the churchyard of Holy Trinity was consecrated that of
St. Mary&rsquo;s was closed, with the exception of some private
vaults; both these burial grounds being closed in 1888, when the
public cemetery was opened; the <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>church part
of which was consecrated on Nov. 7th, in that year, by the Bishop
of Lincoln, Dr. King.</p>
<p>The church is in the Early English style, consisting of nave,
chancel, north and south aisles, north porch, high open belfry
with one bell, and has sittings for 400 persons.&nbsp; The
materials of the structure are white brick, with dressings of
Ancaster stone.&nbsp; It was considerably improved in 1887, and,
more recently, in 1895.</p>
<p>The windows in the north and south aisles are plain small
lancets, in pairs; 5 pairs on the south side, and 4 pairs, with
porch door, on the north.&nbsp; The north and south arcades have
5 bays, with narrow perpendicular arches, except the easternmost,
on both sides, which are wider, with a view to future transepts;
the octagonal columns of brick have nicely carved stone
capitals.&nbsp; The clerestory windows above, 5 on each side, are
alternately quatrefoils and inverted triangles.&nbsp; The roof is
of a very high pitch, slated externally, and internally of deeply
stained deal.&nbsp; The principals of the chancel roof are
ornamented with deeply cut dog-tooth pattern.&nbsp; The choir is
rather narrow, and without aisles.&nbsp; At the east end of the
north aisle is the vestry, the doorway leading to it having a
richly carved arch, supported by twin pilasters, with carved
capitals; the porch doorway has also a richly carved arch, with
dog-tooth moulding, and clusters of pillars below.</p>
<p>The east window in the chancel is of 3 lights, and is an
enlarged copy of the beautiful Early English east window of
Kirkstead Abbey Chapel; with triple columns between, and, on
either side of the lights, having richly carved capitals; the
wall space above being also elaborately carved with floriated
pattern.&nbsp; It was fitted with coloured glass, by an anonymous
donor, in memory of the Rev. T. J. Clarke, in whose vicariate, as
has been stated, the church was built.&nbsp; The subjects are,
running across and in the centre, the Nativity, the Crucifixion,
and Transfiguration; above being the Resurrection, and Christ
sitting in glory; and in the lower row, our Lord as the Good
Shepherd, the Man of sorrows and the Light of the world.</p>
<p>In the chancel walls, north and south, are triple windows in
the same style, but with plain columns and white glass.&nbsp;
Below the east window is a stone Reredos, having four panels with
decorated arches on each side, north and south; with a central
canopy of 3 compartments, nicely carved, and plain cross in the
centre.&nbsp; This was carved and designed by Messrs. F. Bell
&amp; Son, of Horncastle.&nbsp; The Reredos was due to a movement
originating with the Girls&rsquo; Club, then under the management
of Miss Agnes Armstrong; assisted by contributions from members
of the choir, a considerable sum of money being raised by them,
for altar frontals and other fittings in the chancel.&nbsp;
These, and other additions, were dedicated by the late vicar,
Prebendary E. F. Quarrington, on All Saints&rsquo; day, Nov. 1,
1895.</p>
<p>The Organ, on the north side of the choir, is a good
instrument.&nbsp; In the early days of the church an old organ
was transferred from St. Mary&rsquo;s Church and placed at the
west end, but this was sold in 1869, and for some years a
harmonium was used in the choir.&nbsp; The present instrument was
the work of Messrs. Foster &amp; Andrews, of Hull, and has one
manual, with pedals.</p>
<p>The Pulpit, on the south of the lofty chancel arch, is of
stone, having 5 panels with dog-tooth borders, illuminated in
gold and various colours; and having, within central circles,
figures of SS. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the fifth having the
cross with the inscription &ldquo;Feed my sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Reading Desk, on the north, is part of the chancel sedilia; this,
with the Lectern, <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>slightly carved, in front of it, and
all the sittings, are of pitch pine, stained.</p>
<p>At the west end of the south aisle is a plain lancet window of
one light.&nbsp; The window corresponding to this, in the north
aisle, has good coloured glass, in memory of the late Hugh
George, M.D., who died in 1895.&nbsp; It has two subjects (1) The
healing of the lame man by SS. Peter and John, at the beautiful
gate of the temple, and (2) Luke, the beloved physician,
ministering to St. Paul, in prison at Rome.</p>
<p>The west window is of two lights, narrow lancets with circular
window above, having quatrefoil tracery.&nbsp; These are filled
with coloured glass, given by the late Miss Lucy Babington of The
Rookery, Horncastle, in memory of her parents, brothers and
sister.&nbsp; The subject in the upper &ldquo;Rose&rdquo; window
is the Holy Dove descending; those in the window below are (1)
our Lord&rsquo;s Baptism, (2) His commission to the disciples,
&ldquo;Go ye, and baptize all nations;&rdquo; (3) The baptism of
a Jew (St. Paul), and (4) The baptism of a Gentile (Cornelius).

<p>Below this window, and in keeping with the subjects above,
stands the Font, on a plain octagonal base.&nbsp; The bowl is
circular and larger than that in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp;
It is supported by 8 carved pilasters at the angles, with a
central one; rising from these are narrow arches with dog-tooth
moulding.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of the churchyard lie the remains of four
successive vicars of Horncastle, and the wife of a fifth.&nbsp; A
coffin-shaped stone, adorned with a full-length floriated cross,
has this inscription: &ldquo;Thomas James Clarke, M.A., Vicar of
Horncastle, died 14th May, 1853.&nbsp; Is any among you
afflicted, let him pray.&rdquo;&nbsp; This stone was put down by
the Rev. Edmund Huff, <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>who was curate at the time of Mr.
Clarke&rsquo;s death, and afterwards Rector of Little Cawthorpe
near Louth.</p>
<p>An upright stone, the head forming an inverted overhanging
arch, ornamented with dog-tooth pattern (copied from a panel in
the church pulpit), has the inscription: &ldquo;W. H. Milner,
Vicar of Horncastle, died October 3rd, 1868, aged
64.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within the arch is a Calvary Cross, on the steps
of which are these words &ldquo;He that believeth in Me hath
everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the base of the stone is a
quotation from the Burial Service, &ldquo;Blessed are the dead,
which die in the Lord, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; Near this a massive
decorated cross bears the inscription: &ldquo;Robert Giles, Vicar
of Horncastle, died July 12th, 1872.&nbsp; Jesu,
Mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is an exact reproduction of a granite
cross in Willoughby churchyard, erected to the memory of the late
Archdeacon Giles, the vicar&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p>A grass grave, surrounded by a kerb, has resting upon it a
full-length plain Latin cross, along the arms of which is
inscribed &ldquo;Jesu Mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surrounding the kerb is
the inscription &ldquo;Arthur Scrivenor, M.A., Vicar of
Horncastle, born January 13th, 1831, died August 27th,
1882.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never resting, never tiring, in the
endless work of God;&rdquo; the latter words being a quotation
from Dr. Mansel&rsquo;s <i>Life of Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford
and Winchester</i>.</p>
<p>Very near the last tomb is the grave of the wife of the late
Vicar of Horncastle, Prebendary E. F. Quarrington, now Rector of
Welby, near Grantham; the plain slab bears the inscription
&ldquo;At rest, Nov. 25, 1888.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following biographical notes may not be without
interest.&nbsp; The Rev. T. J. Clarke was a remarkable man; born
in this neighbourhood, in a humble rank of life (his widowed
mother occupying a cottage in Woodhall, where, to his honour, he
frequently visited her, and supported her, during his vicariate),
he was apprenticed as a boy to a tradesman in Leeds.&nbsp; A lady
upon whom he attended, as she made purchases in the shop, noticed
his intelligence; the result being that she sent him, at her own
expense, to be educated at a good school, and, in due time,
assisted him to enter at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
where he took Double Honours, and obtained a Fellowship.&nbsp; He
was afterwards appointed to the Vicarage of Penrith, Cumberland,
thus coming under the notice of the Bishop of Carlisle, who, as
Patron, presented him to the Vicarage of Horncastle, on the death
of Dr. Madely in 1845.&nbsp; With Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s arrival in
Horncastle it was felt that a new era in church life had
begun.&nbsp; He threw himself with characteristic energy into
every kind of work, and at one time had 3 curates.&nbsp; To him
was due the erection of Holy Trinity Church, and a great
multiplication of Church services.&nbsp; The old vicarage, a poor
house close to St. Mary&rsquo;s churchyard, was pulled down, and
he rented the house in South Street, with extensive gardens,
which afterwards became the residence of Major Armstrong and now
occupied by Mrs. Howland.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his heavy
parochial work Mr. Clarke (as the present writer can testify)
kept up his classical and mathematical studies.&nbsp; He was also
devoted to music, and a very skilful performer on the
flute.&nbsp; Although these were relaxations from his more
serious parochial labours, the amount of mental work involved
eventually told upon his health, and in the 8th year of his
vicariate it became perceptible, even in his pulpit utterances,
that his mind was affected.&nbsp; He had married a Cumberland
lady, but all her care and attention was unavailing; he gradually
collapsed into a condition of melancholy, scarcely roused by
anything except the music of his piano. <a
name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a>&nbsp; The end <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>inevitable
was seen to be approaching, but unfortunately Mr. Clarke by his
own act anticipated it.&nbsp; Being accidently left alone for a
few moments he took a pistol, which he had concealed in a drawer,
walked out into the garden and shot himself, the overwrought
brain rendering him no longer accountable for his actions.</p>
<p>Of his successor, the Rev. Prebendary W. H. Milner, who, like
Mr. Clarke, had held preferment in the diocese of Carlisle, we
have only to say that he was an able man of business, carried on
the work of the church with great energy, and introduced many
reforms.&nbsp; He built the present vicarage.&nbsp; He was the
last vicar nominated by the Bishop of Carlisle.&nbsp; Of the next
two vicars it may be said that their tenure of office was all too
short, hard faithful labour cutting off the Rev. Robert Giles (as
we have before stated) in 1872, after a vicariate of only 4
years; while the Rev. Arthur Scrivenor died, after 10 years work
in the parish, in his 51st year, in 1882.&nbsp; Canon E. Fowler
Quarrington succeeded him, and held the vicarage during 18 years,
when he was transferred, in 1900, to the Rectory of Welby, near
Grantham.&nbsp; The Rev. Prebendary Alfred Edgar Moore, formerly
Vicar of Messingham, near Brigg, began his vicariate in 1900,
being inducted into the benefice on August 24, in that year.</p>
<p>Horncastle, we may here add, has been well served by its
Curates.&nbsp; &ldquo;Comparisons are (proverbially)
odious,&rdquo; we will not therefore refer to any of these in
recent years; but we may take three typical cases of men whose
memory is still green and redolent of good work.</p>
<p>In the latter years of the amiable vicar, Dr. Madely, he
needed an active assistant, and such was the Rev. William
Spranger White, of Trinity College, Cambridge, a member of a
family of position, the head of which was his uncle, Sir Thomas
Wollaston White, of Wallingwells Park, Worksop, High Sheriff
1839, and formerly of the 10th Hussars.&nbsp; Mr. White possessed
independent means and was very generous.&nbsp; He was of a most
sympathetic nature, and became greatly beloved by all
classes.&nbsp; He worked hard in the parish from his ordination
in 1833 to 1849. <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; In that year he was selected by
the Marchioness of Lothian, to take charge of an Episcopalian
Church, which her Ladyship built and endowed at Jedburgh,
Roxburghshire.&nbsp; The church was opened with an octave of
services, which were attended by the great Doctor Hook of Leeds,
who had recommended Mr. White to her Ladyship.&nbsp; The father
of the present writer, and many leading clergymen from this
neighbourhood, and various parts of England and Scotland,
attended the opening services.&nbsp; Mr. White remained there for
some years, and married the eldest daughter of Lord Chancellor
Campbell, who resided at Hartrigg House, near Jedburgh.&nbsp;
This <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>marriage led to his subsequent return to England, being
appointed by the Lord Chancellor to the Rectory of St. Just, near
Land&rsquo;s End, Cornwall; at a later date promoted to the
Vicarage of Chaddesley Corbett, near Kidderminster,
Worcestershire; and finally in 1859 to the Rectory of
Potterhanworth, near Lincoln, of which cathedral he was made an
Honorary Canon, in recognition of his generous gifts towards
cathedral improvements.&nbsp; Here he did excellent work until
his death in 1893. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p>We next take two of the well chosen curates of the Vicar, T.
J. Clarke, who were contemporaries at Horncastle; Charles
Dashwood Goldie of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where he
took Mathematical Honours in 1847, was ordained as Curate of
Horncastle in 1848.&nbsp; An able preacher and indefatigable
worker in the parish, he at once made his mark, not only in the
town, but in the neighbourhood; he and his beautiful wife being
welcome guests in many a rectory and vicarage.&nbsp; He was also
a man of good social position and private means, and occupied a
good house with large garden on the north side of West Street
(then called Far Street), belonging to the late Mrs. Conington,
within some 120 yards of the railway station, now occupied by Mr.
Sills, and named &ldquo;The Chestnuts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Goldie
being curate at the time when Holy Trinity Church was built
presented the carved oak chairs within the communion rails.&nbsp;
After leaving Horncastle he was appointed to the vicarage of St.
Ives, in the diocese of Ely.&nbsp; The Goldies were an old Manx
family; Col. Goldie, his brother, of the Scotts Guards Regiment,
being President of the House of Keys, the local parliament.&nbsp;
Their residence in that island is &ldquo;The Nunnery,&rdquo; near
the town of Douglas, so called from the ruin close at hand of an
ancient priory, said to have been founded by St. Bridget in the
sixth century.&nbsp; Mr. Goldies&rsquo; nephew is the present Sir
George Dashwood Tanbman Goldie, Privy Councillor, K.C.M.G.,
F.R.G.S., &amp;c, formerly of the Royal Engineers, but latterly
holding various Government appointments, director of several
expeditions in West Africa, having travelled in Egypt, the
Soudan, Algiers, Morocco, &amp;c., and attended the Berlin
Conference in 1884, as an expert on questions connected with the
Niger country, where he founded the Royal Chartered Company of
Nigeria.&nbsp; His latest honour (1905) is the Presidency of the
Royal Geographical Society, in succession to Sir Clements P.
Markham, K.C.B., &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Castle Southey (a relative of the poet) was
Fellow of Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, where he took Classical
and Mathematical Honours in 1847.&nbsp; He was ordained in the
same year, and held the curacy of Horncastle from that year till
1849.&nbsp; He was an able and scholarly preacher and persevering
worker in the parish.&nbsp; On leaving Horncastle he became
Incumbent of the Episcopal Church at Montrose, N.B., which he
held for six years, when he became Assistant Curate of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Church, Brighton, under the Rev. Arthur Wagner; then
Curate of the church of St. Thomas the Martyr at Oxford; then
Vicar of Wendron, Cornwall, and afterwards of Newbold Pacey, near
Leamington, in 1868.&nbsp; After leaving Horncastle he was
invited by the Governors, as an able scholar, to examine the
Horncastle Grammar School, then a considerably larger school than
it has been in later years, with a large number of day boys, and
also boarders from London, many distant parts of the country, and
even from Jersey and the continent.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>As this is the last chapter in which we shall deal with
church matters, we may here say that a Clerical Club, with
valuable library and news room, was established in the town in
the year 1823.&nbsp; At that time there was a numerous community
of country clergymen living in the town; a dozen, or more,
villages in the neighbourhood having no official residence in
their parishes; thus a Clerical Club became a convenient
institution for social intercourse, and valuable papers were
often read at their meetings.&nbsp; This ceased to exist at the
close of the 19th century, when the books were transferred to the
Diocesan Library at Lincoln.&nbsp; In order to enable these
country incumbents to maintain a town residence, they, in several
cases, held a plurality of benefices, which would hardly be
allowed in the present day.&nbsp; Even the Vicar of Horncastle,
Dr. Madely, also held the Vicarage of Stickford, distant more
than a dozen miles; another clergyman was Rector of Martin, Vicar
of Baumber, and Rector of Sotby, several miles apart; while a
third held the Perpetual Curacy of Wood Enderby, 4 or 5 miles to
the south-east of the town, with the Curacy of Wilksby adjoining,
and the Chapelry of Kirkstead, 5 or 6 miles to the west.&nbsp;
Further, to eke out the family income, his daughter found
employment of a somewhat novel kind in the service of the late
Queen Victoria.&nbsp; Being in figure the exact size of the
Queen, her Majesty&rsquo;s dresses were all tried on this lady by
the royal dressmaker; and, as a portion of her remuneration, the
cast-off clothing of the Queen became her perquisite.&nbsp; On
the occasion of the wedding of one of her friends at Horncastle,
the bride and her bridesmaids were all attired in Queen&rsquo;s
dresses.</p>
<p>In connection with the church is the &ldquo;Young
Churchmen&rsquo;s Union,&rdquo; of which the Vicar is
President.&nbsp; They have fortnightly meetings, in the
Boys&rsquo; National School, at 8.15 p.m.&nbsp; There is also a
Church Lads&rsquo; Brigade, No. 1951, attached to the 1st
Battalion, Lincoln Regiment, B 51.&nbsp; This was enrolled Oct.
1st, 1901.&nbsp; The members are youths between the ages of 13
and 19; the present Lieutenant being H. W. Sharpe; Chaplain, the
Vicar; Assistant Chaplain and Correspondent, the Senior
Curate.&nbsp; Entrance fee 1/6, subscription 1d. per week.</p>
<p>The Church National Schools are good substantial buildings,
erected at various periods, the Girls&rsquo; School in 1812, the
Infants&rsquo; in 1860, and the Boys&rsquo; (at a cost of
&pound;1,000) in 1872; the total accommodation is for 300
children, the average attendance being about 250.&nbsp; The
schools were taken over by the Lindsey County Council, on April
1st, 1903.</p>

NONCONFORMIST PLACES OF WORSHIP.</h2>
<p>There are in Horncastle five Nonconformist religious
communities, the Wesleyan, Congregational, Primitive Methodist,
Baptist, and New Church or Swedenborgian, each now having
substantially built chapels, resident ministers, with Sunday,
and, in one case, Day Schools. Through the courtesy of the Rev.
John Percy, late Head Minister of the Wesleyan Society, we are
enabled to give a fairly full account of its origin and growth,
down to the present 20th century.&nbsp; As this is the most
important religious body in the town, next to the Church of
England, although it is not the oldest, we take the Wesleyans
first.&nbsp; As will be seen in the following account, this
Society arose from a very small beginning, but at the present
time, with perhaps the exception of the Baptists, it is the most
numerous and influential body among Nonconformists.&nbsp;
Although, locally, rather fewer in numbers in recent years, than
formerly, it is generally growing, and in the year 1904, as
published statistics show, it acquired in the United Kingdom an
addition of 10,705 full members, with 11,874 members on trial,
and junior members 4,367; a total increase of 26,946.</p>
<h3>THE WESLEYANS.</h3>
<p>The founder of this Society was, as its name implies, John
Wesley, probably of the same stock as the great Duke of
Wellington, whose family name was variously written Wellesley, or
Wesley. <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a>&nbsp; We take the immediately following
particulars mainly from the <i>History of England</i>, by Henry
Walter, B.D. and F.R.S., Fellow of St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, Professor in the <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>East India
College, Hertford, Chaplain to the Duke of Northumberland,
&amp;c., &amp;c., himself a Lincolnshire man.</p>
<p>John and Charles Wesley were the second and third sons of
Samuel Wesley, Rector of Epworth, near Gainsborough; <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> John being born in 1703 (June 17), and
Charles in 1708 (Dec. 18).&nbsp; John was educated at the
Charterhouse, and Charles at Westminster School.&nbsp; In due
course they both entered at Oxford University; John eventually
being elected to a Fellowship at Lincoln College, and Charles to
a Studentship at Christchurch.&nbsp; In 1725 John was ordained
deacon of the Church of England.&nbsp; He left Oxford for a time
to act as his father&rsquo;s curate, Charles remained as Tutor to
his college.&nbsp; He, with some of his undergraduate pupils,
formed a custom of meeting on certain evenings every week for
scripture study and devotion, they carefully observed the
Church&rsquo;s fasts and festivals, and partook of the Holy
Communion every Sunday.&nbsp; From the strict regularity of their
lives the name was given to them, by those who were laxer in
conduct, of &ldquo;Methodists.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p65b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Wesleyan Chapel"

"Wesleyan Chapel"
src="images/p65s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In 1729 the Rector of Lincoln College summoned John Wesley to
resume residence at Oxford, and he became Tutor of the
College.&nbsp; In this capacity he was careful to look after the
souls, as well as the intellectual training, of those under his
influence.&nbsp; The brothers began missionary work in Oxford,
about the year 1730, in which they were assisted by a few other
kindred spirits.&nbsp; They visited the sick and needy, with the
permission of the parish clergy, as <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>well as
offenders confined in the gaol.&nbsp; This continued for some
time, but gradually John began to long for a wider field for his
spiritual energies.&nbsp; He had gathered about him a small band
of equally earnest associates, and they went out to Georgia,
North America, in 1735, to work among the English settlers and
North American Indians.&nbsp; After two years John returned to
England, in 1737, and then began the work of his life.</p>
<p>It is said that he was a good deal influenced by the <i>De
Imitatione Christi</i> of Thomas a Kempis (of which he published
an abridged edition in 1777), <a name="citation66a"></a><a
href="#footnote66a" class="citation">[66a]</a> also by Jeremy
Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Holy Living and Dying</i>; and he imputed his
own conversion to his study of Law&rsquo;s <i>Serious
Call</i>.&nbsp; His &ldquo;first impression of genuine
Christianity,&rdquo; as he called it, was from the Moravian sect,
with whom he came in contact at Hirnuth in Saxony, which he
visited in 1738, after his return from America; but his complete
&ldquo;conversion,&rdquo; he was wont to say, occurred at a
meeting of friends, in Aldersgate Street, London, where one of
them was reading Luther&rsquo;s <i>Preface to St. Paul&rsquo;s
Epistle to the Romans</i>, the exact time being 8.45 p.m., May
24, 1738.</p>
<p>Though taking an independent course, and appointing only lay
workers as his agents, he regarded himself to the end of his days
as an ordained minister of the Church of England, and his society
as still being a part of it, and he urged all faithful Wesleyans
to attend church service once on Sunday, and to receive the Holy
Communion at church, it being only after his death that the
society&rsquo;s secession became complete. <a
name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a></p>
<p>The first Wesleyan congregation of about 50 members, some of
them Moravians, was formed in London, where they met in Fetter
Lane, once a week; the first meeting being on May 1st, 1738, and
from that day the society of &ldquo;Methodists&rdquo; may be
regarded as having begun. <a name="citation66c"></a><a
href="#footnote66c" class="citation">[66c]</a>&nbsp; The birth of
the sect in Lincolnshire may be said to date from his visit to
Epworth, in 1742.</p>
<p>In 1743 he divided the whole county into two sections, or
circuits, the eastern and western.&nbsp; Of the eastern Grimsby
was the head; this included Horncastle, and gradually comprised
some 15 other subsidiary centres, extending from Grimsby and
Caistor in the north, to Holbeach in the south.</p>
<p>His earliest recorded visit to Horncastle was in 1759, when he
addressed a large concourse of people in a yard, supposed to be
that of the Queen&rsquo;s Head Inn, near the Market Place, on
April 4th and 5th.&nbsp; On July 18th, 1761, he again preached
here, and on July 18th, 1774, he addressed, as his journal
states, &ldquo;a wild unbroken herd.&rdquo;&nbsp; On July 6th,
1779, he says &ldquo;I took my usual stand in the Market Place,
Horncastle, the wild men were more quiet than usual, Mr.
Brackenbury, J.P., of Raithby Hall, standing near
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Mr. Robert Carr Brackenbury remained his
firm friend through life; and we may here add that he granted to
Wesley the use of his hay loft at Raithby for religious services,
further securing the use of it in perpetuity, by his will, to the
Wesleyan body, so that the curious anomaly has occurred that,
when the hall was bought in 1848, by the Rev. Edward Rawnsley,
the house became the <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>residence of an Anglican clergyman,
yet bound to allow the loft over his stable to be used for
nonconformist worship.&nbsp; In recent years the stable has been
unused as such and the loft made more comfortable, being
furnished with seats, pulpit, &amp;c</p>
<p>Wesley, throughout his life, generally visited Horncastle
every two years, his death occurring on March 2nd, 1791.&nbsp;
There is in Westminster Abbey a mural memorial of John and
Charles Wesley, having within a medallion, the bust-sized
effigies of the two brothers, beneath which is inscribed the
saying of Wesley, &ldquo;The best of all is God with
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Below this, within a panel, is a representation
of John Wesley, preaching from his father&rsquo;s tomb in Epworth
churchyard.&nbsp; Beneath are two more quotations from his own
words, &ldquo;I look upon all the world as my parish,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;God buries His workmen, but carries on His
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the head of the slab is the inscription
&ldquo;John Wesley, M.A., born June 17th, 1703, died March 2nd,
1791.&nbsp; Charles Wesley, M.A., born December 18th, 1708, died
March 29th, 1788.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The growth of the society was not rapid, and for some years
was subject to fluctuations.&nbsp; In 1769 Grimsby had 56 members
and Horncastle 42, including such well-known local names as
Rayson and Goe.&nbsp; In 1774 Grimsby had fallen to 32 members
and Horncastle to about the same.&nbsp; In 1780 Horncastle had
only 31 members, but the numbers had increased in the
neighbourhood; Kirkby-on-Bain having nearly as many as
Horncastle, viz. 29, Wood Enderby 10, Hemingby 7, and Thimbleby
18; there being evidently a greater readiness to accept the new
teaching among the simpler rural population.</p>
<p>In 1786 Horncastle was made the head of a circuit to itself,
and in that year the first chapel in the town was built, the
whole circuit then numbering 620 members.&nbsp; This chapel was
near the site of the present Baptist place of worship.&nbsp; A
few years later the opposing barrier among the upper class seems
in some degree to have given way, as, in 1792, we find the name
of Joseph Bass, a &ldquo;physician,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;leader.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1800 there was further growth in
the country, Greetham having 21 and Fulletby 26; among the latter
occurring the still well-known names of Winn (Richard and
Elizabeth), 5 Riggalls, and 5 Braders.&nbsp; By this time there
were 6 circuits formed in Lincolnshire, and congregations at
Newark and Doncaster.</p>
<p>Although there was a chapel at Horncastle there was no
minister&rsquo;s residence until after 1786.&nbsp; At that date
John Barritt rode over from Lincoln to preach, and finding no
Wesleyan minister&rsquo;s house, he was taken in and hospitably
entertained by a Mr. Penistoun, who was &ldquo;a great
Culamite.&rdquo;&nbsp; After staying the night with him he rode
on next day to Alford, for Sabbath duty.&nbsp; On the death of
John Wesley (1791) his mantle fell, and indeed, had already
fallen, in several cases, on shoulders worthy of the commission
which he conferred upon them.&nbsp; The first resident ministers
were the Rev. Thomas Longley, Superintendent; the above John
Barritt was the second, and Richard Thoresby the third.</p>
<p>Hitherto it had not been a service free from difficulty, or
even danger.&nbsp; Itinerary ministers had to make their journeys
on duty, often long and wearying, on horseback, over bad country
roads, even occasionally incurring hardship and peril.&nbsp; In
1743 Mr. John Nelson was sent by Wesley to Grimsby, and his
journals describe severe labour and even persecution.&nbsp;
Another pioneer, Thomas Mitchell, was thrown by a mob into a pool
of water, and, when drenched, was painted white from head to
foot.&nbsp; He was afterwards thrown into a pond more than 12
feet deep, rescued and carried to bed by friends, he <!-- page
68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>was
thrice dragged out of his bed because he would not promise not to
visit the place (Wrangle) again.&nbsp; Wesley himself, in his
journal (May 10, 1757) says &ldquo;I preached to a mixed
congregation, some serious, others drunk;&rdquo; but on the other
hand, in 1764, he preached, when the chapel &ldquo;though having
its galleries, was too small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have named John Barritt among the early Horncastle
ministers.&nbsp; He was preaching on one occasion at Boston, when
a band of roughs forced their way into the chapel and interrupted
the service, driving some of the congregation away.&nbsp; He had,
however, a more serious experience, from exposure to the
roughness of the elements.&nbsp; He was riding to Boston,
apparently by a somewhat circuitous route, and a violent storm
arose at sea.&nbsp; When he was not far from the coast the sea
bank gave way, the country was inundated, vessels were even
carried some distance inland, Boston itself was deluged, and he
might have been drowned, but that he managed to reach some high
ground, and arrived safely at Sibsey.</p>
<p>About this date, we are told, the progress of Wesleyanism
excited the jealousy of the clergy, not so tolerant as they are
now, and a meeting was held at the Bull Hotel, Horncastle, at
which it was argued that the &ldquo;spread of Methodism was one
of the causes of the awful irreligion&rdquo; prevalent, that the
ministers were &ldquo;raving enthusiasts, pretending to divine
impulse, and thus obtained sway over the ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Barritt was re-appointed to Horncastle in 1801, as
Superintendent, his colleagues being Thomas Rought, John Watson,
and Squire Brackenbury as supernumerary, the latter was also,
about this time, appointed head of the society in Spilsby. <a
name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a>&nbsp; J. Barritt was grandfather of
Robert Newton Barritt, who was very popular in Horncastle,
1882&ndash;1884.&nbsp; Wesley&rsquo;s characteristic advice to
him had been &ldquo;When thou speakest of opinions, or modes of
worship, speak with coolness, but when thou speakest of
Repentance, Faith and Holiness, then, if thou hast any zeal, show
it!&rdquo; and to these principles he was ever true.</p>
<p>Other ministers of note at different periods were George
Shadford, a name still surviving in the town; Charles Atmore, who
wrote sundry Wesleyan hymns; Thomas Jackson, a great scholar,
twice elected President of the National Conference; Digory Joll,
grandfather of the present Mr. Watson Joll (to whom the writer
owes much of the information here utilized); and to these we may
add Benjamin Gregory, 1817; Robert Ramm and Robert Bryant, 1830;
<a name="citation68b"></a><a href="#footnote68b"
class="citation">[68b]</a> Bryant was called a &ldquo;son of
thunder,&rdquo; from his great energy.</p>
<p>In 1835 Leonard Posnet was a popular minister, not only in the
town but in the country around, being much appreciated by the
farmers from his intimate acquaintance with their
avocation.&nbsp; He was followed (1838&ndash;1840) by Joseph
Kipling, grandfather of the now well-known Rudyard Kipling.&nbsp;
Joseph Clapham was a faithful minister from 1843 to 1845, and was
succeeded by (1845&ndash;1848) &ldquo;Father&rdquo; Crookes,
&ldquo;Preacher&rdquo; Wood, and the &ldquo;saintly&rdquo;
Fowler, who was said to have made 900 converts.</p>
<p>Then followed Wright Shovelton, Martin Jubb, Peter
Featherstone, Henry <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Richardson, and others, among whom it
would be invidious to make distinctions.&nbsp; We may add that a
famous missionary of this sect was Thomas Williams, son of John
Williams, a cabinet maker of Horncastle, the latter being an
active member of the Wesleyan Sunday School Committee.&nbsp; His
first wife, mother of the missionary, was Miss Hollingshead, who,
with her mother, kept a girls&rsquo; school, near the Bow
Bridge.&nbsp; A <i>History of the Fiji Mission</i>, issued in
1858, says &ldquo;The good ship Triton sailed from England, Sep.
14, 1839, carrying out the Rev. T. Williams, and his wife, to
Lakamba, Fiji.&rdquo;&nbsp; They arrived there July 6,
1840.&nbsp; He there built a mission house and chapel, where he
laboured several years, the mission growing in extent, until it
was beyond his strength.&nbsp; In June, 1852, Mr. Moore was
appointed as a colleague to relieve him of some of the work, but
again his health broke down, and he was obliged to leave, after
13 years&rsquo; hard labour, in July, 1853.&nbsp; He went to
Australia and took various charges in that country, being chosen
President of the Mission at Ballarat in 1873.&nbsp; He re-visited
England in 1861, and again in 1881, returning to Ballarat, as a
supernumerary, but still officiating.&nbsp; The present writer
well remembers the impression made by a lecture, given by Rev. T.
Williams, at the Bull Hotel, Horncastle.</p>

70</span>Among the latest ministers of note has been the Rev.
John Percy, who gave up his charge as Superintendent in 1904, and
was succeeded by the Rev. E. Hayward, who left Horncastle on
Thursday, Aug. 29, 1907, for work at Bridlington; he was
succeeded by Rev. John Turner, of Colchester, who was 6 years ago
in Louth Circuit, <a name="citation70a"></a><a
href="#footnote70a" class="citation">[70a]</a> the Rev. G. German
Brown continuing as assistant.&nbsp; He was succeeded by the Rev.
M. Philipson, B.A., coming, with his wife, since deceased (March
14, 1906), from Stanley, near Durham, where they were the
recipients of valuable presents on their departure.</p>
<p>In recent years no member of the society has been more valued
than the late octogenarian, Mr. John Rivett, J.P., who died Sept
4, 1906.&nbsp; For nearly 70 years he was a generous supporter of
the cause; he represented the district at no less than 13
Conferences, in various parts of the country, and at the Leeds
Conference, in 1882, he spoke for an hour and a quarter in
advocacy of its principles.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Lunn, of Horncastle
and West Ashby, is also well known, as, for many years, an able
local lay preacher and practical man of business; he was a
representative at Conferences in London and at Burslem.</p>
<p>Of the buildings in Horncastle, connected with this society,
we have gathered the following details.&nbsp; As already stated
the first chapel was erected in Cagthorpe about the year
1786.&nbsp; It stood a few yards to the north of the present
Baptist place of worship, which is close to the north-west corner
of the Wong.&nbsp; The early history of this first erection is
little known, but a letter written by Rev. T. Williams of
Ballarat, dated May 10, 1889, to the late Mr. W. Pacy, states
that, after some years, it was replaced by a larger building, of
which the dimensions are elsewhere given, as being length 54-ft.,
by width 36-ft., with 4 large windows, having pointed heads, on
the north side, and single windows on the south and west; a small
porch at the south-east corner, facing the Baptist Chapel, giving
entrance to the body and galleries; a door at the south-west end
for the use of the minister, opening near the pulpit, which was
at the west end; the eastern gable being the roadway
boundary.&nbsp; Of these &ldquo;pointed&rdquo; windows the Rev.
T. Williams says, &ldquo;the lancet windows, with quarry panes,
were a whim of Mr. Griggs Lunn and of my father.&nbsp; Of this
building some remains are still visible, to the height of about 3
feet, in the south wall of Mr. Scholey&rsquo;s garden, about 50
yards to the north of the Baptist Chapel.&nbsp; Towards its
erection a number of masons, joiners, and others, who could not
afford subscriptions, gave their labours gratuitously.&nbsp; Two
houses for ministers were also built close by.</p>
<p>In 1836 a third chapel was begun, on a new site in Union
Street (now Queen Street), and was opened on Good Friday in the
following year, the interior fittings being transferred from the
second building in Cagthorpe.</p>
<p>In 1866 a movement was commenced, with a view to the erection
of a still larger chapel, and the present fine building was the
result; opened in 1869, with accommodation for over 1,000 persons
(1024), at a cost of &pound;5,876. <a name="citation70b"></a><a
href="#footnote70b" class="citation">[70b]</a>&nbsp; The Sunday
School adjoining, with large class rooms and infant school being
built in 1875, at a further outlay of &pound;2,578.&nbsp; The
fittings of the chapel are of stained polished deal, the gallery
front and pulpit are white, picked out with gold, the latter
standing upon 4 round-headed arches of light and graceful
design.&nbsp; A new organ was erected soon after the opening of
this chapel, at a cost of &pound;300, and in 1883 the instrument
was enlarged and improved.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>In 1886 the Centenary of Wesleyanism was celebrated and
the occasion was marked by a strenuous effort to clear off the
debt from the Horncastle Circuit.&nbsp; This effort was
supplemented by &ldquo;Ye olde Englyshe Fayre, houlden in ye
Exchange Hall, Nov. 20, 21 and 22, MDCCCLXXXVIII;&rdquo; and at a
tea gathering on March 12, 1889, it was stated that the original
debt had, in the previous two years, been reduced to &pound;60,
and since then the whole had been cleared off, the exact sum
raised being &pound;1,526 2s. 4d.; while, as an evidence of the
general prosperity of the Society, the Chairman stated that in
the last 24 years debts had, throughout the country, been paid to
the total amount of no less than &pound;1,226,245. <a
name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a"
class="citation">[71a]</a></p>
<p>In 1860 a former foundry show room, in Foundry Street, built
by the late Mr. Tupholme, was acquired through the generosity of
Mr. J. Rivett, to be used as a mixed day school; it had one large
general room, four classrooms, and two large yards, and afforded
accommodation for more than 400 scholars.&nbsp; The premises cost
&pound;450, but before the school was opened some &pound;1,300
had been spent in adapting them to educational purposes.&nbsp;
This has now been superceded by an even more commodious building
in Cagthorpe, on the south branch of the canal, at the corner
near the Bow Bridge, opposite St. Mary&rsquo;s Square, at a cost
of &pound;2,500.&nbsp; It has a very large room for a mixed
school, another for an infant school, with classrooms and
everything required, in accordance with the latest conditions by
Act of Parliament.&nbsp; The foundation stone was laid June 22,
1904, and the school was formally opened Jan. 4, 1905.</p>
<p>A Young Men&rsquo;s Institute was established in the beginning
of 1889, by the Rev. G. White, then Superintendent Minister, for
which the classroom of the Sunday School was to be available for
their use, every evening except Sunday, supplied with daily
papers, magazines, &amp;c.; classes also being held for the
consideration of important subjects and for mutual improvement;
these are still continued.&nbsp; There is also a Wesley Guild,
which meets every Friday evening, in the band room, Queen Street,
at 8 o&rsquo;clock, during the winter months, and on the first
Friday evening in the month during the summer.&nbsp; Marriages
are celebrated in this chapel. <a name="citation71b"></a><a
href="#footnote71b" class="citation">[71b]</a></p>
<h3>THE PRIMITIVE METHODISTS.</h3>
<p>We have given an account of the rise and progress of
Wesleyanism, but, as that society eventually made a complete
separation from the Church of England, of which its founder
remained through life an ordained minister and communicant, so
the seeds of disruption spread in itself.&nbsp; At different
periods it threw out off-shoots, amounting in all to some eight
different daughter societies; such as those which are named
&ldquo;The Original Connection,&rdquo; &ldquo;The New
Connection,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Primitive Methodists,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; Of these the last alone is represented in
Horncastle.&nbsp; More than 50 years ago <a
name="citation71c"></a><a href="#footnote71c"
class="citation">[71c]</a> the Primitives had, in this country,
2,871 places of worship, with 369,216 sittings; with the
exception of the &ldquo;Original Connection,&rdquo; none of the
other off-shoots had then as many as 100,000 sittings.</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>In Horncastle the first chapel, opened in 1821, was a
small building, situated on the left side of what is now
Watermill Yard, to the north of the town.&nbsp; This proving too
small for the growing congregation, a larger structure, an oblong
building, with front gable at the east end and a gallery, was
erected in 1837; the minister&rsquo;s house being at the west
end.&nbsp; This was about half way up Watermill Road, on the
north side, now a stable, but still retaining a pointed
window.&nbsp; This building was of the date of the
superintendency of the Rev. John Butcher.&nbsp; The residence was
found to be too damp to be comfortable, and a house was taken for
him in Prospect Street.&nbsp; In the early days of this chapel
Mary Crossley, a Revivalist, occasionally preached here.&nbsp;
Possibly the services at this time were rather too demonstrative,
as they were not unfrequently interrupted by roughs, and the sect
acquired the name of &ldquo;The Ranters.&rdquo; <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a>&nbsp; An amusing anecdote is related of
Mr. Butcher; he was a somewhat eccentric character, and in the
discharge of his intinerant ministrations he usually rode on a
donkey, sometimes accompanied by her foal; and a waggish
passer-by on the road is said, on one occasion, to have saluted
them with the greeting &ldquo;Good morning, ye three,&rdquo;
adding <i>sotto voce</i>, &ldquo;donkeys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few years this second chapel was found lacking in
accommodation and a third building, the present edifice, was
erected in Prospect Street, in the year 1853, with sittings for
380, at a cost of about &pound;1,100.&nbsp; As this is a
substantial structure, likely to last for many years, we may here
describe it.&nbsp; It is of red brick, except the arch of the
western door, which has a band of white bricks; the bricks are
larger than usual, being 3&frac14; inches in thickness.&nbsp; The
entrance has a double door opening into a lobby, at each end of
which is a staircase, leading to the north and south
galleries.&nbsp; There is a window on each side of the door,
three windows above, and over them, in the gable, a stone, with
the inscription &ldquo;Primitive Methodist Chapel,
1853.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the east end of the interior is a Rostrum,
12-ft. long, divided into two stages, the front one being 8
inches above the floor, the second, behind it, about
4&frac12;-ft. high, with access by steps at both ends.&nbsp; The
front of this platform has slender piers, supported by lancet
arches, with trefoils and quatrefoils between, giving a graceful
effect, and painted white, gold, and grey, with a background
chocolate in colour.&nbsp; At the back of the rostrum are eight
arches in the pannelling.&nbsp; This is said to have been a copy
of the arrangement in Bardney Chapel.&nbsp; Over the rostrum is a
recess in the east wall, containing the harmonium, which cost 40
gs., and seats for the choir.&nbsp; The sittings in the body of
the chapel are of stained and varnished deal.&nbsp; At the rear
of the chapel, entered by doors at each side of the rostrum, is a
large room for the Sunday School, with two smaller class rooms
above it.&nbsp; The erection of this building was due to the
exertions of the Rev. J. Haigh, who was appointed minister in
1850, and as an exception to the usual custom, he was requested
to continue his ministry for four years.&nbsp; We may add that,
at the opening service of this third chapel the ministers present
were Rev. J. Haigh, as Superintendent; Rev. T. Fletcher; Rev. R.
Pinder, then at Coningsby; Rev. J. Garbutt, Supernumerary, from
West Ashby.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Fletcher was appointed as Second
Minister in Horncastle, at that time, for two years; he became in
1872 Superintendent Minister for three years, and again 1884 for
four years, leaving for Market Rasen in 1888.&nbsp; During the
ministry of Rev. J. Haigh in Horncastle, several chapels were
built in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Horncastle was at first included in the Lincoln Circuit,
but in 1837, at the building of the second chapel it was
constituted a separate circuit, and when the third chapel was
erected, in 1853, Coningsby was made a branch of Horncastle.</p>
<p>The first preacher who visited Horncastle was a female, Jane
Brown by name, who is said to have walked from Lincoln to
Horncastle on a Sunday morning, giving an address in the Market
Place in the afternoon, and in the evening holding a service in a
house, now forming part of the back premises of the Red Lion
Hotel.&nbsp; The first local preachers were also females, Mary
Allen and Mary Clarke.&nbsp; The first two female members were
Mary Elwin and Martha Belton.</p>
<p>Mr. Butcher having been the first resident minister, was
succeeded by the Rev. C. Smith, who worked here and in various
other places during 50 years, and then retired to York as
supernumerary.&nbsp; The Rev. William Rose, who had been Second
Minister in 1850, was appointed Superintendent in 1875, and
remained two years.&nbsp; A few years later the Rev. J. Pickwell
(1888&ndash;90) was Superintendent, with Rev. W. Whitaker as
Second Minister; the former first joined the society as a scholar
in 1849, being numbered among the local members, he afterwards
removed to Lincoln, and acted as Itinerant Minister for 33 years
before returning to Horncastle in 1888.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwell was
succeeded by Rev. William Kitson as Superintendent, with Rev. R.
H. Auty as Second Minister.&nbsp; Mr. Kitson retained his post
during four years, when he left for Market Rasen.&nbsp; Mr. Auty
was followed, as Second Minister, by Rev. John Bowness, and he,
in turn, by Rev. Thomas Stones.</p>
<p>In 1894 the Rev. John Featherstone succeeded to the ministry,
with Rev. W. J. Leadbetter as Second Minister, both these stayed
to their second year, Mr. Featherstone dying in 1896.&nbsp; In
that year the Rev. John Worsnop was appointed, with Rev. A. W.
Bagnall as Second Minister; the former retained his post during
five years; Mr. Bagnall two years, being succeeded in 1898 by
Rev. Walter Tunley, and he, in 1899, by the Rev. George H.
Howgate, who stayed two years.&nbsp; In 1900 Rev. J. Worsnop
retired to Newcastle-on-Tyne, and died there in Dec., 1904.</p>
<p>In 1901 the Rev. Matthew H. Chapman became Superintendent
Minister, with Rev. J. A. Kershaw as Second, both remaining
during two years.&nbsp; In 1903 the Rev. Robert B. Hauley
succeeded, with Rev. J. Cousin as assistant, both remaining two
years.&nbsp; In 1905 (July) the former left for Kirkby Stephen,
Westmoreland, the latter for a circuit in Shropshire.&nbsp; They
were followed by the Rev. E. Allport, from Skegness, as
Superintendent, Sept. 1905; and Rev. E. J. Hancox from
Doncaster.&nbsp; In June of that year the annual Conference was
held at Scarborough.</p>
<p>We will now put together a few details of the origin of this
society.&nbsp; Hugh Bourne was born at Stoke-upon-Trent, April 3,
1772. <a name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; Although his family was said to
be ancient, his ancestors having come to England at the Norman
Conquest, he belonged to a humble rank in life, living at Ford
Hays Farm.&nbsp; He was in early life educated by his mother, a
godly woman, and while very young he learnt by heart the Te Deum,
the Litany, and much of the prayers of the Church of
England.&nbsp; He worked for his father, and an uncle who was a
millwright, but found time to study hydrostatics, pneumatics,
natural philosophy, <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>as well as Hebrew, Greek and
Latin.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s influence had given him a serious
bent of mind, and he early acquired strong religious
convictions.&nbsp; His biographer says of him &ldquo;He tells, in
child-like simplicity, how, when only four or five years old, he
pondered over thoughts of heaven and hell, the last judgment, and
other solemn subjects.&nbsp; During the next 20 years his inner
life was one of hopes and fears, doubt and faith, conflict and
victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother, going to Burslem on business, borrowed of a
Wesleyan friend, some religious books, among them being
Baxter&rsquo;s <i>Call to the Unconverted</i>, Allen&rsquo;s
<i>Alarm</i>, and a sermon by Wesley on <i>The Trinity</i>.&nbsp;
Her son Hugh naturally read these, and Wesley&rsquo;s sermon made
a great impression upon him.&nbsp; One Sunday morning he was
sitting in his room, reading Fletcher&rsquo;s Letters on <i>The
Spiritual Manifestation of the Son of God</i>, when he declares
that he was led &ldquo;to believe with his heart unto
righteousness, and with his mouth to make confession unto
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was in his 27th year, A.D.
1799.&nbsp; He joined the Wesleyan society in June of that year,
the special occasion being a love feast at Burslem, to which he
was taken by an aged neighbour, a farmer near Bemersley, named
Birchenough, at whose house services were conducted, who offered
him a ticket which constituted him a member, and thus in his own
words I was &ldquo;made a member without knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we shall presently see Hugh Bourne became one of the two
originators of the Primitive community, the other was his friend
and neighbour William Clowes, a sketch of his career was
published some years ago, <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a> from which we cull
the leading particulars.&nbsp; He was born at Burslem 12th March,
1780, his mother, a daughter of Aaron Wedgewood, being a near
relation of Josiah of that name, the inventor of the famous
Wedgwood pottery.&nbsp; At ten years of age (1790) he began work
in his uncle&rsquo;s pottery, which he continued for several
years.&nbsp; At that time dancing, gambling and pugilism were the
chief amusement of the factory men and colliers of Staffordshire,
and for some years he led a wild life of dissipation, yet this
was accompanied, at times, with a sense of self-condemnation and
spiritual consciousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I was ten years
old,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I remember being at a prayer meeting
conducted by Nancy Wood, of Burslem, in her father&rsquo;s house,
when, convinced of the sin of disobedience to my parents, I wept
bitterly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conflicts between good and evil continued
to disturb him for several years.&nbsp; When a young man, at a
dance in Burslem, he was so suddenly convicted of sin, that he
abruptly withdrew.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards he married, but he
and his wife quarralled so violently that he left her, and went
off, taking with him only his mother&rsquo;s prayer book.&nbsp;
After some wandering, without a penny in his pocket, he returned
and begged his wife to attend the Wesleyan Chapel regularly with
him, but she refused.&nbsp; He then, prayer book in hand, took an
oath that he would serve God and avoid dissipation.&nbsp; This
oath, however, was broken; but once more in the early hour of a
cold January morning he went forth, and seeing a faint light
burning in a window, he entered the house, to find a few humble
methodists gathered for an early prayer meeting.&nbsp; There, he
says, he knelt unnoticed, but there he &ldquo;died to sin, and
was born of God.&nbsp; This, I said, is what they call being
converted.&nbsp; I was fully persuaded that I was justified by
faith, and had peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; From that day, Jan. 20th, 1805, he began a
new life.</p>
<p>The time now approaches when the two, Hugh Bourne and William
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Clowes began the great work of their life.&nbsp; At the
beginning of the 19th century Bourne, being much employed at
Harriseahead, near Bemersley, was shocked at the general lack of
the means of grace, and he endeavoured in 1800 and 1801 to
promote a revivalist movement.&nbsp; Daniel Shubotham, a boxer,
poacher, and ringleader in wickedness, was brought, through
Bourne&rsquo;s influence, to the Saviour, on Christmas day 1800,
and with his natural energy of character took up the cause.&nbsp;
Matthias Bailey, another of Bourne&rsquo;s old associates was
also won over, and cottage prayer meetings were begun among the
colliers.&nbsp; A meeting upon Mow Cop was proposed for a day
given to prayer.&nbsp; At this time Lorenzo Dow, an American
Wesleyan visited the Black Country, as the coal district of
Staffordshire was called.&nbsp; He spoke of the American camp
meetings, himself preaching at Congleton, when Hugh Bourne, with
his brother James, was present; William Clowes being also a
hearer.&nbsp; They bought books of Lorenzo Dow, which had a
marked effect on the future.&nbsp; On May 31st, 1807, a camp
meeting was held on Mow Cop, a hill in the neighbourhood, Bourne
and Clowes being present.&nbsp; Stands were erected and addresses
given from four points.&nbsp; Bourne organized two companies, who
continued by turns praying all the day; others giving accounts of
their spiritual experiences, among whom Clowes was prominent, and
his words are &ldquo;The glory that filled my soul on that day
exceeds my powers of description.&rdquo;&nbsp; Persons were
present on this occasion from Kilham in Yorkshire and other
distant places, one, Dr. Paul Johnson, a friend of Lorenzo Dow,
coming from Ireland.</p>
<p>The movement had now taken definite form and substance.&nbsp;
Another camp meeting followed at the same place on July 19,
lasting three days; a third on August 16th, at Brown Edge; a
fourth on August 23rd, at Norton-in-the-Moors.&nbsp; At this time
was held the Annual Wesleyan Conference, at which handbills were
issued denouncing this separate movement.&nbsp; For a brief
moment Bourne, Clowes and Shubotham hesitated; but the question
was seriously considered at a meeting at the house of a friend,
Joseph Pointon, when it was &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; to Bourne that
the camp meetings &ldquo;should not die, but live;&rdquo; and
from that moment he &ldquo;believed himself to be called of
God&rdquo; for the new work; and shortly his brother James, James
Nixon, Thomas Cotton, and others, gave themselves to the
cause.</p>
<p>For some years the labours of these men and their associates
were chiefly devoted to the pottery and colliery districts of
Staffordshire, where a remarkable change was brought about in the
moral condition of the hitherto almost brutalized people.&nbsp;
The area of work was then gradually enlarged, extending
throughout the whole country, and even, as we shall presently
see, beyond it.&nbsp; The following are a few personal details of
Hugh Bourne&rsquo;s subsequent career.</p>
<p>In 1808, on his way to Bemersley from Delamere Forest, an
impression forced itself upon him that he would shortly be
expelled from the Wesleyan connexion; on reaching home he found
that a rumour to this effect was being circulated, and in June of
that year the formal sentence of expulsion was carried out.&nbsp;
He continued to devote himself to the work of evangelization,
urging however all others to join whatever denomination they were
themselves most inclined for.</p>
<p>He preached his first sermon at Tunstall, on Nov. 12, 1810, in
a kitchen which had been licensed for preaching three years
before.&nbsp; It was not plastered or ceiled, so that if not
required at any future time, it might be converted into a
cottage, which took place in 1821, when a chapel was
erected.&nbsp; At the Conference held at Newcastle-on-Tyne, in
1842, he was most regretfully placed <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>on the
retired list, on account of his impaired health, a yearly pension
of &pound;25 being assigned to him.&nbsp; He was still, however,
to be at liberty to visit different parts of the connection; and
during the next ten years of his superannuation he kept up a very
wide correspondence on religious matters, and made a missionary
visit to America.&nbsp; The last conference which he attended was
at Yarmouth, in 1851.&nbsp; For several years he had felt a
premonition that the year 1852 would be his last.&nbsp; The last
sermon which he preached was at Norton Green, on Feb. 22, 1852;
and on Oct. 11, in that year, he surrendered his happy spirit
into the hands of God, who gave it, when &ldquo;the weary wheels
of life stood still.&rdquo;&nbsp; His chief residence would
appear to have been at Bemersley, where it was long felt that
they had lost in him &ldquo;a man of great faith and mighty
prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now pass over a period of several years.&nbsp; Clowes
received a call to Hull.&nbsp; He had crowded the work of a
life-time into some 17 years, and his health was now far from
good.&nbsp; At a meeting in December, 1827, he exhibited such
weakness as showed that he had done his best work.&nbsp; However,
he continued to reside in Hull and visited other places from
there, as his strength allowed.&nbsp; It is certain that he
visited Horncastle, for an old lady, Mrs. Baildham, who died in
May, 1900, having been a member of the connection more than 70
years, frequently asserted that she had heard both Clowes and his
wife preach in, presumably, the second chapel in Mill Lane.</p>
<p>At the Conference in 1842, 35 years after the first camp
meeting on Mow Cop, both Clowes and Bourne were present; but the
assembly was saddened to see the original founders, of what was
now a thoroughly established and wide-spread community, both
shattered in health and broken by toil.&nbsp; Nine years later
Clowes said to a friend &ldquo;I feel myself failing fast, I am
fully prepared.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke of the glories of heaven,
and said &ldquo;I shall possess it all through the merits of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; His speech began to fail, but he got
downstairs, and once more led his class.&nbsp; On the Saturday he
attended a committee meeting; on Sunday he was too weak to go to
chapel; on Monday there was further weakness; early on Tuesday
slight paralysis; and on March 2, 1851, he quietly passed to his
rest, aged 71.&nbsp; The people of Hull were greatly moved, and
many thousands lined the streets as the funeral procession passed
to the grave, at which the Rev. William Harland briefly recited
the story of the good man&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Of the general progress of the connexion, we may say, that
down, to 1870 it was simply a Home and Colonial body, but, in
that year, the Norwich branch sent out the missioners, Burnett
and Roe, to the island of Fernando Po, on the west coast of
Africa.&nbsp; This was in response to an appeal from the
Fernandians, who had been converted by a member of the connexion,
Ship Carpenter Hands, of the ship Elgiva, who, with his godly
Captain, Robinson, had in the course of trade visited that
country.&nbsp; The same year also saw a mission established at
Aliwal North, in the eastern province of Cape Colony.</p>
<p>In 1884 the Primitive Methodists of Canada formed themselves
into an independent community, although with expressions of
mutual good will on both sides; their numbers at that time were
8223, with 99 travelling and 246 local ministers, and 237
chapels.</p>
<p>From the middle of the 19th century to its close was a period
of great expansion, a return in 1888 reporting the existence in
Great Britain of 4,406 chapels, there having been in 1843 only
1278.&nbsp; In 1864 Elmfield College was opened at York, as a
middle class school, one of their best; John Petty being <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>first Warden; in 1876 a college was opened at
Birmingham, named after the great founder, &ldquo;Bourne
College.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Sunderland a Theological College was
opened in 1868, the former Infirmary building being bought; and
here, from that date till 1881, Dr. William Antliff, assisted,
and afterwards, succeeded by Mr. T. Greenfield, trained
candidates for the ministry.&nbsp; The college was afterwards
transferred to a new building at Alexandra Park, Manchester.</p>
<p>In 1889, at the 70th Annual Conference, held in Bradford, the
membership of the society numbered 194,347, with 1,038 itinerant
and 16,229 local preachers; 430,641 Sunday School scholars, 4,436
chapels and 1,465 smaller places of worship; the value of the
connexion&rsquo;s property being estimated at over
&pound;3,218,320.</p>
<p>For these details I am largely indebted to the notes of the
late Mr. William Pacy, of the Wong, Horncastle, and to the
courtesy of the Rev. R. B. Hanley, Minister 1903&ndash;5.</p>
<h3>THE INDEPENDENTS.</h3>
<p>Next in size to the Wesleyan Chapel and its Sunday Schools, on
the west side of Queen Street, are the Chapel and Sunday Schools
of the Independent, or Congregational, community, which stand
nearly opposite, on the east side of the same street; the former
being a handsome substantial building of brick, enclosed by a
high wall, and tall iron rails and gate, to the precincts in
front, at the north end.&nbsp; Its dimensions are 50-ft. by
36-ft., with schools behind, of the same solid structure, as will
be seen hereafter, erected at a later date.</p>
<p>Like the Baptists this society dates from the time of the
Commonwealth, or even earlier, though at first known by a
different name.&nbsp; They arose, indeed, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; The persecutions of Protestants, under Queen
Mary, drove many to take refuge in Germany and in Geneva, where
they became familiar with the worship of the sects established
there, which, as an unchecked reaction from the superstitious and
elaborate ceremonies of Roman Catholicism, took a more extreme
form than the carefully developed Reformation of the English
Church allowed.&nbsp; These persons, returning to England in the
reign of Elizabeth, found, as it seemed to them, too much Romish
doctrine and practice still retained; the Reformation, according
to their ideas, had not gone far enough.</p>
<p>The Queen, as head of the English Church, was not disposed to
listen to their demands for further change, and they were
themselves too much divided to have the power to enforce them;
dissension and disruption were the consequence.&nbsp; A chief
mover in this process of disintegration was one, Robert Brown,
who founded a sect called the &ldquo;Brownists.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was the son of a Mr. Anthony Brown, of Tolethorpe near Stamford,
in Rutlandshire, whose father, a man of good position, had
obtained the singular privilege (granted only to others of noble
birth) by a Charter of Henry VIII., of wearing his cap in the
presence of Royalty.&nbsp; Robert Brown was educated at
Cambridge, graduating from Corpus Christi College, and became a
Schoolmaster in Southwark.&nbsp; About 1580 he began to put
forward opinions condemnatory of the established church.&nbsp; He
held, as opposed to the uniformity of worship by law established,
that each minister, with his congregation, were &ldquo;a law unto
themselves;&rdquo; that each such small community had a right to
be independent of all others; that it was not ordination which
gave a minister authority to preach, but the fact that he was the
nominee of a congregation; that councils or synods might <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>be useful in giving advice, but that they could not
enforce their decisions, and had no punitory power of censure, or
excommunication, against any who chose to adopt an independent
course.</p>
<p>Such opinions, put forward in somewhat intemperate language,
aroused much opposition and bitter feeling, which Brown was too
impetuous to avoid, or to mitigate.&nbsp; He continued his
teaching and presently formed a congregation at Norwich, holding
his views.</p>
<p>An Act of Parliament had been recently passed (23 Eliz., c. 2)
which made anyone guilty of felony who should write, or set
forth, seditious matter; and the Queen, as supreme head of the
Church, regarded Brown&rsquo;s action as an interference with the
Royal prerogative.&nbsp; Severe measures were adopted in order to
restrain this new teaching.&nbsp; Two preachers, Elias Thacker
and John Copping, who embraced and proclaimed these tenet, were
tried at the Bury Assizes in 1583, condemned, and shortly
afterwards hanged.&nbsp; Brown was himself thrown into prison,
but released through the intercession of Lord Burghley, with whom
he was connected.</p>
<p>He now left England, and, with a number of followers settled,
by permission of the state, at Middlebourg, in Zealand, where
they formed a congregation.&nbsp; There, however, freed from all
restraint, their principles of independence carried them so far
that differences arose among themselves, which broke up the
community.&nbsp; Brown presently returned to England, and for a
time conformed to the Church, which he had so freely abused,
being allowed even to hold the Benefice of Thorpe Achurch, in
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; But again and again his independence
asserted itself, and it is said that he incurred imprisonment no
less than 32 times, finally ending his days in Northampton
jail.&nbsp; While at Middlebourg he had published, in 1582, a
book entitled <i>A Treatise of Reformation</i>, of which he sent
many copies to England, and it was for distributing these, and
other of his pamphlets, that the two above-named offenders were
executed. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; (Collier&rsquo;s
<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.)</p>
<p>The movement which Brown originated did not die with himself,
and in 1593 a congregation of Brownists was formed in London,
which numbered some 20,000 members.&nbsp; A few years later their
obnoxious tenets again provoked persecution, and once more they
had to take refuge on the continent.&nbsp; Churches were
established by them at Amsterdam and elsewhere, the principal one
being at Leyden, under the Rev. John Robinson, who afterwards
came to be regarded as the founder of Independency.&nbsp; He was
a man of considerable attainments; of more genuine piety than the
impetuous Brown; and while equally with him, holding that each
congregation was in itself a perfect and independent church,
under Christ, he would avoid all bitter invective against other
communities, who, with different regulations, might still be
regarded equally as churches.</p>
<p>Although the Brownists had no regularly ordained ministry; as
newly constituted under Robinson, there were a number of
ministers elected by the congregations, and no one was allowed to
teach publicly until, after due <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>examination,
he had been pronounced qualified for the work.&nbsp; The
Independents differ chiefly from other religious societies, in
that they reject all creeds of fallible man, their test of
orthodoxy being a declaration that they accept the Gospel of
Jesus Christ, and adhere to the scriptures as the sole standard
of faith and practice.</p>
<p>In 1616 a number of the society again returned to England
under the leadership of Henry Jacobs, who had served under
Robinson, and once more established a meeting house in London;
while others, in charge of a Mr. Brewster, who had been a lay
Elder, also under Robinson, went out, in 1620, to North America,
in the good ship Mayflower, and another vessel, and founded a
colony at Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Although, as has been already stated, under the influence of
Robinson sectarian bitterness was much modified, yet throughout
the reigns of James I. and Charles I., the Independents were in
frequent conflict with the Presbyterians; nor was there only
sectarian strife, for both parties had numerous supporters in
Parliament, as well as partizans in the army.&nbsp; Preaching
Generals and praying Captains abounded; but Cromwell favoured the
Independents, as against Presbyterians, and this gradually paved
the way for toleration.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At the &ldquo;Savoy Conference&rdquo; in London (so called
because held at the palace of that name), in 1658, the
Independents published an epitome of their faith, and henceforth,
with occasional interruptions, they held on their way; although
it was not till 1831 that the &ldquo;Congregational Union of
England and Wales&rdquo; was finally and fully constituted.&nbsp;
They again published, in 1833, a more definite &ldquo;Declaration
of Faith, Order, and Discipline,&rdquo; which continues still to
be the charter of the community.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>We have seen that in the early annals of this society
the name of John Robinson stood high in general estimation, but
his was by no means the only honoured name.&nbsp; Among early
members of mark was Dr. John Owen, of Queen&rsquo;s College,
Oxford, a learned writer, and Chancellor of the University in
1652; he became Chaplain to Protector Cromwell, as an
Independent.&nbsp; The Rev. Isaac Watts, who had been tutor to
the sons of Sir John Hartop, became the popular minister of a
Congregational Chapel, in Mark Lane, London, in 1693.&nbsp; Dr.
Philip Doddridge was also a valued member, as Minister at
Norwich, Northampton, Kibworth near Market Harborough, and other
places.&nbsp; From his candour and learning he held friendly
relations with the highest dignitaries of the established church;
he is chiefly known for his two great works, <i>The Rise and
Progress of Religion in the Soul</i>, and his <i>Family
Expositor</i>.&nbsp; To the regret of many he died of
consumption, at a comparatively early age, in 1751, at Lisbon,
whither he had been ordered by his doctors for the milder
climate.&nbsp; The friend and biographer of the last-named, Mr.
John Orton, was another esteemed member, who published several
valuable works, he died in 1783.</p>
<p>Another was Robert Hall, who ministered at Cambridge,
Leicester and Bristol, where he died in 1831.&nbsp; He was a
great writer and very eloquent preacher.&nbsp; Professedly he was
a Baptist, but he frequently occupied Independent platforms, and
admitted that he had more feeling of fellowship with an
Independent than with a strict Baptist. <a
name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a"
class="citation">[80a]</a>&nbsp; None of these, however, was more
highly esteemed than Dr. Isaac Taylor, of Norwich and Colchester,
author of several instructive works, and commonly called
&ldquo;the glory of the Independents.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in
1829.</p>
<p>By the year 1851 this community had grown to such dimensions
that it had, in England and Wales, 3,244 chapels, with a
membership of 1,002,307. <a name="citation80b"></a><a
href="#footnote80b" class="citation">[80b]</a></p>
<p>The connection of the Congregationalists with Horncastle is of
comparatively recent date, and the evidence on this subject is
somewhat conflicting.&nbsp; Weir, in his <i>History of
Horncastle</i>, published in 1820, does not name them, in his
list of Nonconformists, as existing here at that time, but
Saunders&rsquo; <i>History</i>, published in 1836, gives them
with the others.&nbsp; Hence they would appear to have
established themselves in the town somewhere between those two
dates; yet there exists a curious small publication, entitled
&ldquo;The Confession of Faith of the Society of his
Majesty&rsquo;s Protestant subjects (dissenting from the Church
of England) called Independents, in Horncastle, in the County of
Lincoln, and places adjacent, Framed in the year of Christ, 1781,
by W. R. Lincoln, printed by S. Simmons.&rdquo; <a
name="citation80c"></a><a href="#footnote80c"
class="citation">[80c]</a></p>
<p>The inference from these facts would seem to be, that, at that
date, 1781, there was an Independent congregation in the town,
probably small, consisting of &ldquo;W.R.&rdquo; and his personal
adherents; as the wording of the confession is said <a
name="citation80d"></a><a href="#footnote80d"
class="citation">[80d]</a> to be very remarkable, and indeed
unique, &ldquo;W.R.&rdquo; was evidently rather of an eccentric
turn of mind, which led him to publish this authoritative
statement of Faith.</p>
<p>The society, probably, in a few years became extinct, and it
is not till the <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>year 1820 that we find any sign of
their revival.&nbsp; <i>The Church Book</i> supplies the
following details: In 1820 certain worshippers in the Wesleyan
Chapel of that day, finding their religions views not in accord
with general Wesleyan sentiment, decided to erect a chapel of
their own; and for this purpose they selected a site in East
Street, at the north west corner of Foundry Street, where now
stands the house, 42, East Street.&nbsp; This building was opened
for public worship on March 22, 1821; the morning preacher being
the Rev. B. Byron of Lincoln, the Rev. John Pain, a Hoxton
student, preaching in the afternoon, and the Rev. Thomas Hayes of
Boston, in the evening.</p>
<p>Mr. Pain officiated for a few weeks and then returned to
Hoxton to complete his education for the ministry.&nbsp; He had,
however, left a pleasing impression behind him, and he was
afterwards invited, in an address signed by 130 of the townsfolk,
to come and settle among them as their first permanent
minister.&nbsp; He commenced his labours, in that capacity, in
July of the same year.&nbsp; Under his ministry the congregation
rapidly increased, and the first chapel was soon found to be too
small; and in September of the same year a new site was purchased
at the north-east corner of Union Street, now Queen Street.&nbsp;
While this chapel was being built (which is still their place of
worship) they were allowed by the Wesleyans to make use of their
chapel, at stated times; some of their services also being, for
the time, held at the British Schools, on the site of which the
1st Volunteer Drill Hall was afterwards erected, now the carriage
repository of Messrs. Danby &amp; Cheseldine.</p>
<p>At the opening of this chapel, on March 28, 1822, the Rev.
George Waterbourne, of Dewsbury, preached in the morning, and the
Rev. Joseph Gilbert, of Hull, in the evening.&nbsp; On Thursday,
May 9th, following, seven persons formally announced themselves
to be a church on Independent principles, viz., William Barton
and his daughter Mary, John Jackson and Elizabeth his wife,
William Parker (Solicitor), Mary Ball and Rebecca Brown.&nbsp;
The Rev. John Pain was duly ordained to the ministry on May 10,
those officiating on the occasion being the Rev. W. Harris,
LL.D., Theological Tutor of the Hoxton Academy, the Rev. B. Byron
of Lincoln, and Rev. J. Gilbert of Hull.&nbsp; In July of that
year three members were added to the church, in 1823 eight more
were enrolled, in 1824 three more, and in 1825 six joined.</p>
<p>During this year a vestry was built at the back of the chapel;
in May of the same year a Sunday School was commenced, which at
the end of the year numbered 60 scholars; and the congregation
gradually grew, year by year, until Mr. Pain died in 1844 (April
11).&nbsp; He was much beloved, and had brought into the fold
about 150 members.&nbsp; He was interred in the chapel yard, a
large stone on the west side marking his grave, while a tablet on
the south wall, at the east end of the interior of the chapel
bears this inscription, &ldquo;Sacred to the memory of the Rev.
John Pain, who was ordained Pastor over this church and
congregation, Anno Domini 1821.&nbsp; As a minister he was
talented, zealous and useful, his chief desire being to bring men
unto God.&nbsp; As a man he was amiable and affectionate, his
private life bearing testimony to the truth of those counsels he
publicly taught.&nbsp; He departed this life April 11th, 1844,
aged 44 years.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inscription on the tombstone is a
long one, in verse, to which is added an epitaph to
&ldquo;Esther, Relict of the above,&rdquo; who &ldquo;died in
London, Feb. 1, 1868, aged 64.&nbsp; With Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the ministers of this chapel Mr. Pain was probably the
most valued, and his memory is still cherished.&nbsp; We may add
that he was born in Gloucester, a descendant, on his
mother&rsquo;s side, of the old and honourable family of the <!--
page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>D&rsquo;Oyleys, whose seat is at Adderbury,
Oxfordshire.&nbsp; His father was many years Pastor of the
Independent Church of Forest Green, Gloucestershire, his mother
being daughter of a Church of England clergyman.&nbsp; An
engraving of him is still preserved, framed, in the vestry of the
chapel.</p>
<p>Mr. Pain was succeeded in the ministry of the chapel by the
Rev. J. Kelsey in 1844; he died in Adelaide, South Australia; and
from 1845 to 1848 the Rev. W C. Fisher held the post.&nbsp; The
Rev. Samuel Gladstone succeeded him, and officiated from 1848 to
1853.&nbsp; He afterwards went to Sleaford.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. G. Roberts was Minister from 1853 to 1856.&nbsp;
He married a daughter of the late Mr. T. Meredith; there being a
tablet to the memory of the latter, on the west side of the south
wall of the chapel, with this inscription, &ldquo;In affectionate
remembrance of Mr. Thomas Meredith, who departed this life July
30, 1858, aged 66 years.&nbsp; As for me I will behold Thy face
in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy
likeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Betty succeeded in 1857, and held office till
1863, when his health broke down; his last entry in the books was
written on Feb. 19, 1863, &ldquo;God bless them all, church and
congregation, Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; He returned and died at
Knottingley, March 26, 1865.&nbsp; During his ministry a debt of
&pound;75 on the chapel was paid off, and in 1859 a
minister&rsquo;s house was purchased for &pound;250, and some
&pound;30 spent in repairs, the money being raised by a
bazaar.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Lord followed in 1863, and ministered till
1866.&nbsp; He succeeded in paying off the debt on the British
School, and on leaving the town was presented with a handsome
timepiece by the Committee of the School.&nbsp; He had as a youth
attended the chapel of Dr. Doddridge (already named) in
Northampton, but left there in 1834.&nbsp; His first pastorate
had been at Wollaston, from 1834 to 1845; then removing to
Brigstock, where he ministered from 1845 until his transfer to
Horncastle in 1863. <a name="citation82"></a><a
href="#footnote82" class="citation">[82]</a></p>
<p>He was succeeded by the Rev. J. E. Whitehead, from 1867 to
1871.&nbsp; During his ministry several improvements were
effected in the interior of the chapel, including the erection of
a commodious platform; oak furniture and elegant fittings being
added, and the seats of the choir re-arranged.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. Rose followed from 1872 to 1878.&nbsp; He had been
stationed at Portsea, but visited Horncastle in July, 1872, to
preach for Home Missions, and was afterwards invited to undertake
the ministry here.&nbsp; Being a native of Boston, and having
resided for some time in Spilsby, he was glad to return to his
native county, and commenced his ministry in January, 1873.&nbsp;
During his pastorate the old seats in the body of the chapel were
removed, and modern open benches substituted.&nbsp; In 1874 a
plot of land was offered by the late Mr. W. A. Rayson for new
school premises.&nbsp; Mr. Rose and the late Mr. J. E. Ward, as
Treasurer and Secretary, took up the matter, and the present
schools were erected on the south of the chapel.&nbsp; On the
ground floor is a spacious room, 39-ft. long by 24-ft. wide;
there is a vestry for the minister, an infant classroom, and a
kitchen with convenient arrangements for tea meetings; above are
six large classrooms for boys and girls.&nbsp; These were opened
April 29, 1875; among the contributors being Mr. Samuel Morley of
London, at one time President of the Society, and Sir Titus Salt,
who both, with Mr. W. A. Rayson, gave &pound;50 each.</p>
<p>After Mr. Rose&rsquo;s retirement both he and Mrs. Rose still
continued to take a kindly interest in matters connected with the
chapel.&nbsp; She was a member of <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>a highly
respectable family in the neighbourhood, being a daughter of Mr.
Searby of Wainfleet.&nbsp; Her health, however, was latterly
precarious, and she died May 16, 1879, her husband dying Dec. 10,
in the same year.&nbsp; They were both interred at Spilsby.&nbsp;
Mr. Rose was highly esteemed among all denominations; was on
cordial terms of intimacy with the Rev. Arthur Scrivenor, then
Vicar of Horncastle; and, among other duties, he acted on a
committee at Woodhall Spa, in connection with a Cottage Hospital
for the poor, in which he took great interest, and which was
carried on by the writer of these pages, then Vicar of Woodhall
Spa.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose was succeeded by the Rev. W. T. Poole, of
Paulers&rsquo; Pury, Northants; a former Scripture Reader at
Reading, who ministered here from 1878 to 1880, when he was
transferred to Bracknall, Berks.&nbsp; He was followed by a
Nottingham student, the Rev. W. Archer, from 1881 to 1885.&nbsp;
Then came the Rev. J. H. Dingle, of Ruskington, near Sleaford,
from 1885 to 1886, when he left for a charge at Patricroft, near
Manchester.&nbsp; During his pastorate a very successful Bazaar
was held in November, 1886, from the proceeds of which the manse
was further improved, and the chapel again renovated, with
decorations from the designs of Mr. C. H. Stevens.</p>
<p>Then followed an interval of two years, during which the
chapel was served by students of the college at Nottingham.&nbsp;
In 1888 the Rev. G. Luckett succeeded, coming from Long Sutton,
and held office till Sept., 1893, when he was transferred to
Curry Rivell, Somerset.&nbsp; An interval here again occurred,
during which Mr. J. T. Whitehead and other Nottingham students
took the duties, Mr. Whitehead afterwards accepting a pastorate
in Lancashire.</p>
<p>In January, 1894, the Rev. Sidney Benjamin Dixon began his
ministry, which he continued till December, 1897, when he was
transferred to Tetsworth, Oxfordshire.&nbsp; For more than a year
Nottingham students again performed the duties; and in November,
1899, the Rev. John Pogson, B.D., entered on his ministry, which
he continued until 1905, when he was transferred to Whitworth,
near Rochdale.&nbsp; Early in 1907 (Feb. 13) the Rev. J. H.
Dingle, who had held the office in 1886, was re-appointed, having
served, as above, 12 years at Patricroft, and afterwards at
Newmarket and Sheffield.</p>
<p>There is one more tablet in the chapel, which we have not
mentioned; it is on the west wall, &ldquo;In affectionate
remembrance of Jane, the beloved wife of William Wood, who died
May 12, 1853, aged 48 years.&nbsp; Precious in the sight of the
Lord is the death of His saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Wood was a
draper in the High Street, and a pillar of the church; he
afterwards removed to Southampton, and died there.</p>
<p>We have only to add that there are a considerable number of
tombstones, with inscriptions, in the chapel yard, but burials
ceased to take place there by Act of Parliament in 1855.&nbsp;
Marriages are here solemnized.&nbsp; The Services are morning and
evening on Sunday, with sermon in the evening of Thursday.&nbsp;
A Young People&rsquo;s Society of Christian Endeavour Meeting on
Tuesday at 8 p.m.&nbsp; A Ladies&rsquo; Sewing Meeting on the
first Wednesday of every month, and choir practice on Friday
evening at 8, there being a good American organ.</p>
<p>For the above details I am largely indebted to the notes
&ldquo;On the Wong,&rdquo; of the late Mr. W. Pacey, supplemented
by the <i>History of England</i>, in seven volumes, of the Rev.
H. Walter, B.D., F.R.S., Professor in the East India College,
Hertford, Chaplain to the Duke of Northumberland, &amp;c.,

84</span>THE BAPTIST CHAPEL.</h3>
<p>This is the oldest nonconformist building in Horncastle.&nbsp;
It is generally supposed that there was a still earlier chapel,
situated near what is called the Bow Bridge, which spans the
southern branch of the canal, between Cagthorpe and St.
Mary&rsquo;s Square, but we have no definite proof of this beyond
a vague tradition.</p>
<p>The Baptist community date their origin from the time of the
Commonwealth.&nbsp; The earliest person of note connected with
this religious body being John Bunyon, author of <i>The
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, <a name="citation84a"></a><a
href="#footnote84a" class="citation">[84a]</a> who espoused the
cause of the Parliament against Charles I.&nbsp; He first
preached in Bedford, where he was a tinker by trade, in the year
1655, visiting various other parts of the country in succeeding
years, until he died, August 31st, 1688, and was buried in

<p>An old document shows that at a meeting held at Bedford, in
the spring of 1655, over which he presided, it was decided to
send one of the members, &ldquo;Mr. Brown to Horncastle, in
Lincolnshire, to a few persons of the belief, seeking help to
guide them in forming a society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before the
&ldquo;Toleration Act&rdquo; was passed in 1689, nonconformist
places of worship were not allowed to exist within five miles of
a market town. <a name="citation84b"></a><a href="#footnote84b"
class="citation">[84b]</a>&nbsp; In Asterby, about six miles from
Horncastle, there is a Baptist chapel, locally reputed <a
name="citation84c"></a><a href="#footnote84c"
class="citation">[84c]</a> to be the oldest in the kingdom.&nbsp;
At Coningsby is a Baptist Chapel, with a school, dating from
nearly the same period, with an endowment of 26 acres of
land.&nbsp; The Baptists of Horncastle mostly, in those days,
worshipped at Asterby.&nbsp; At Donington-on-Bain there is also a
very ancient chapel, where the Baptists of Louth
worshipped.&nbsp; The two chapels of Asterby and Donington have a
joint endowment of &pound;20 a year, and are now affiliated to
Northgate Chapel in Louth.</p>
<p>The Foundation Deed of the Chapel in Horncastle is dated Sept.
19, 1767; and the names of the founders are given as William
Bromley, Vicars Keal, Hamlet Dabney, William Taylor, William
Storr, William Dawson, Thos. Hollingshed, Charles Bonner, George
Gunnis, James Coates, John Blow, and William Tenant.</p>
<p>The Chapel was originally a structure of one story, having its
entrance in the centre of the north wall, and the pulpit
opposite.&nbsp; Until the early part of the 19th century it had
no baptistry, immersion being performed in the water-mill pit, <a
name="citation84d"></a><a href="#footnote84d"
class="citation">[84d]</a> in the north of the town.</p>
<p>Considerable structural alterations were made in the year
1843, when the walls were heightened and upper windows inserted;
a gallery was erected at the east end; the north door was bricked
up, and the present entrance at the east end opened; the pulpit
being removed to the west end, facing the door.&nbsp; A further
enlargement was made by a small vestry on the west being added,
thus providing sitting accommodation for 250 worshippers.</p>
<p>On the north side of the building is a graveyard, but only
three inscriptions <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>are legible, they are &ldquo;Mary
Markwell, died March 28th, 1776, aged 29.&nbsp; Prepare to meet
thy God.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, doubtless, one of the earliest
interments.&nbsp; The second is &ldquo;In memory of Thomas Lamb,
who departed this life June 7th, 1811, aged 82.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here rests that lately animated clod,<br />
Who self despised, and glorified his God;<br />
And when that great decisive day shall come,<br />
He&rsquo;ll rise triumphant from the silent tomb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also of Frances, his wife, who departed this life April 2nd,
1810, aged 79.&nbsp; He was a watchmaker.&nbsp; The third is as
follows: &ldquo;Sacred to the memory of Eliza, daughter of
William Parker, Solicitor, and Elizabeth, his wife, who died 1st
April, 1835, aged 20 years.&nbsp; Them that sleep in Jesus will
God bring with Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Parker occupied part of the
premises now forming the shop and residence of Mr. Bryant,
shoemaker, in the High Street.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the house adjoining the chapel, on
the north west, was once the minister&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; On
the stairs leading to the present rostrum there is still a
doorway, which evidently led to the house.&nbsp; There is a stone
tablet over this door, and in 1892 an exact copy of this was
made, and placed on the north wall.&nbsp; The inscription reads
&ldquo;John Hill, departed this life Oct. 16th, 1779, aged 48,
Pastor of this Church 13 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some tablets on the wall within, but the Rev. F.
Samuels, who was Pastor when the Chapel was renovated, about
1882, unfortunately allowed the inscriptions to be
obliterated.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that the Mint Lane Baptist Chapel,
at Lincoln, was founded in 1767, by worshippers at Horncastle. <a
name="citation85a"></a><a href="#footnote85a"
class="citation">[85a]</a>&nbsp; Curiously it was not till 1892
that the Horncastle Chapel was &ldquo;registered&rdquo; as a
place of worship, the omission being only then discovered, when
application was made for a licence to solemnize marriages.</p>
<p>In 1893 the Chapel was thoroughly restored, at a cost of
&pound;80; the interior being modernised, the walls painted, the
old high pews removed and replaced by neat seats, the old
box-shaped pulpit taken down, and a rostrum and platform
erected.&nbsp; There is a good organ, with special seats for the
choir.</p>
<p>We may add that the Baptists are now a very numerous and
influential body.&nbsp; At the Baptist World Conference, held at
Exeter Hall, London, July 10 and following days, 1905, the first
ever held as an united community, Dr. Maclaren of Manchester
presiding, a message was received from the King and Queen,
thanking for a loyal address from the Conference.&nbsp; The
President also stated that he had informally received a greeting
of good will from the Established Church, as well as from the
Free Churches.</p>
<p>On that occasion ministers and delegates attended from various
parts of Great Britain and the Colonies, from America, France,
and other countries.&nbsp; A meeting was held under &ldquo;The
Reformer&rsquo;s Tree,&rdquo; in Hyde Park, Miss Burroughs, a
coloured lady, being on the platform, also Mr. Britto, a coloured
vocalist, and the singing being led by a coloured choir.&nbsp;
The President, Dr. Clifford of London, stated that there were
present 4,000 delegates, from all parts of the world,
representing some seven millions of Baptists, <a
name="citation85b"></a><a href="#footnote85b"
class="citation">[85b]</a> and 5,700,000 <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>communicants;
but besides these there are 14 or 15 millions of
&ldquo;adherents&rdquo; to the cause, so that the whole body
numbers over 20 millions.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. E. Pearson was appointed August, 1905, but left in
Feb., 1907, to pursue his studies at college.</p>
<h3>THE NEW JERUSALEM CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The Croft Street Chapel, or New Jerusalem Church, is both
structurally and intellectually, the most recent developement of
Nonconformity in Horncastle.&nbsp; The founder of this community
was a personality so remarkable that it may be well here to give
a brief sketch of him.</p>
<p>Emanuel Swedenborg, son of a Lutheran bishop, was born at
Stockholm, in 1689.&nbsp; During more than the first half of his
life he was distinguished as a hard worker in the field of
science, and from his many clever inventions, and valuable public
services, he was ennobled by his sovereign.&nbsp; But in the year
1743, after a serious illness, accompanied by brain fever, the
result of excessive mental labour, he threw up all work of this
kind, declaring that he had received a &ldquo;call&rdquo; from
the Lord, who manifested Himself to him, by personal appearance,
and commissioned him to devote further life and strength to
holier purposes.</p>
<p>Being a man of strong will, albeit, not improbably, with a
touch (as was thought by several) of mental aberration, the
result of his illness, he threw himself, with characteristic
energy, into the work of religious proselytism, in support of the
special views with which he was now inspired.&nbsp; He became a
kind of religious clairvoyant, living an ecstatic existence in
communion with angels and spirits.&nbsp; He printed accounts of
various &ldquo;Arcana,&rdquo; as he termed them; visions granted
to him of heaven and hell; the state after death, the true
worship of God, the inner spiritual sense of the scriptures; and
so forth.&nbsp; He held spiritual intercourse with the dwellers
in other planets, conversing with Apostles, with Luther, Calvin,
Melancthon, &amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Things hidden since the days of
Job (he declared) were revealed to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Followers gradually gathered round him, inspired by his own
enthusiasm.&nbsp; He visited England frequently; and before his
death, in London, A.D. 1772, he had established congregations in
England, Ireland, Wales, France, Holland, Sweden, Russia, and
even in Turkey and America.&nbsp; It is said that several
Anglican clergy adopted his views, though still retaining charges
in their own church.</p>
<p>The special tenets of the sect, which he founded, seem to have
been, that, while believing in one God, they held that He was the
Christ; that Christ always existed in human form, but not in
human soul; and that in His Person there was a real Trinity; that
the bible was to be understood in a spiritual sense, which was
first revealed to Swedenborg.&nbsp; Their ritual, which was based
on that of the Anglican Church, included a splendid priesthood
and an elaborate ceremonial.</p>
<p>Swedenborg&rsquo;s very numerous writings included a number of
mystic works, especially connected with what he called the
&ldquo;Spiritual Influx,&rdquo; which was not limited to locality
but pervaded everywhere.&nbsp; Translations of all his works have
been issued by the Swedenborg Society, located at No. 1,
Bloomsbury Street, London, W.C., and at Horncastle they may be
borrowed from the New Church Free Library in Croft Street.&nbsp;
The Horncastle branch has also its own monthly magazine, <i>The
New Church Advocate</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>The following is a brief account of the Society&rsquo;s
origin and progress, in Horncastle, from particulars furnished to
the present writer, by the esteemed minister, Rev. R. Mayes, in
1903 (the second year of his ministry), and by Mr. Edwin Townell,
who has been secretary for a quarter of a century.&nbsp; The
Society was inaugurated on August 9, 1869, when Messrs. Bogg,
Moore, Hall, Cook, Austin, and Bellamy, met at the house of Mr.
E. J. Moore, 19, Queen Street; Mr. Moore being appointed
Secretary and Treasurer, Mr. Bogg and Mr. Hall Trustees, and Mr.
Bogg nominated as first Leader.&nbsp; Mr. Cook offered the use of
a room in his house, rent free, and the first service was held on
the following day, Sunday, the 10th of the same month.</p>
<p>As Mr. Bogg resided at Benniworth, nine miles from Horncastle,
he could not undertake a service every Sunday; and, at first
there was only an evening meeting, weather permitting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>There was a good deal of opposition for a time, especially
from the Congregationalists, under their minister, Mr. J. E.
Whitehead; this, however, served rather to increase the general
interest in the new movement, and the evening congregations grew
in numbers.&nbsp; The first tea meeting (which ultimately became
an established monthly institution) was held March 14, 1870, in a
room in the alley named &ldquo;Tinker&rsquo;s Entry,&rdquo; there
being then 14 members on the roll; when addresses were given by
Mr. J. S. Bogg, Chairman; and by Messrs. Cook, Moore, T. Wemyss
Bogg, and others.</p>
<p>In May of the same year Mr. Richard Gunton, of the
Lincolnshire New Church Association, visited them, followed by
Rev. John Hyde in October, Mr. Gunton coming again in December of
the same year.&nbsp; We may here observe that this connection
with Mr. Richard Gunton became, as will be hereafter shewn, a
most valuable asset in the Society&rsquo;s favour, in more ways
than one.&nbsp; He took up his residence in London, first in
Oseney Crescent, <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Camden Road, N.W., and afterwards in
Tufnell Park Road, N., but he never lost his interest in the
Horncastle branch; visiting the town year after year, to preach
or give lectures, in the Corn Exchange, on behalf of the
Society.&nbsp; His last visit was in October, 1896; his death
occurring on the 5th of the December following, after (as was
fitly stated) &ldquo;40 years of faithful service as
Superintendent Missionary,&rdquo; as well as having been
Treasurer of the New Church Conference.</p>
<p>In 1871 Mr. Moore left Horncastle, the room in Tinker&rsquo;s
Entry was given up, and the meetings were held in the house of
Mr. W. Hall, where a library was also opened for the
members.&nbsp; Subsequently, with a view to the erection of a
suitable place of worship, Mr. Hall bought a piece of land in
Croft Street and presented it to the Society, the project being
also warmly supported by Mr. R. Gunton.&nbsp; A subscription list
was opened, plans and estimates obtained, and the foundation
stone of a fabric was laid, Sep. 16, 1872.&nbsp; The appeal for
support concluded with these words: &ldquo;This will be the first
house of worship constructed in the County of Lincoln, for the
worship of the Lord Jesus Christ as the only God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was signed by W. Hall, Treasurer, and Edwin Dawson,
Secretary.</p>
<p>The Chapel was opened Jan. 29, 1873, being dedicated by the
Rev. Dr. Bayley, Minister of the Chapel in Argyle Square, London;
who had given a series of lectures in aid of the Society four
years before (November, 1869) in the Corn Exchange; and, after
the dedication, he again gave addresses, which were continued by
Revs. P. Ramage, R. Storry, C. H. Wilkins, Mr. R. Gunton, and
others, usually morning and evening.</p>
<p>We will now describe the Croft Street fabric, opened under
these favourable auspices.&nbsp; It consists of a square oblong,
standing north and south, 40-ft. by 20-ft.; the architect was Mr.
Gosling of London, the builder Mr. Chas. Blyton of Horncastle,
the material being red and white brick.&nbsp; There is
accommodation for 150 persons; the cost of the structure was
&pound;350.&nbsp; The fittings, which had formerly belonged to a
chapel in Cross Street, Hatton Gardens, London, were presented by
Mr. William Pickstone.&nbsp; At the south end there is an apsidal
recess with three lancet windows, the central one having coloured
glass, with the figure of the Good Shepherd and an inscription at
the bottom stating that it was &ldquo;Presented by J. W Fishleigh
and Fanny his wife, in memoriam, Feb., 1901,&rdquo; being in
memory of their only daughter, who died in London, the mother
having been brought up in this connection.</p>
<p>Within this apse there is a platform, with polished oak rail
in front, resting on carved pillars.&nbsp; On this is a Reading
Desk and Communion Table.&nbsp; The carpet and communion cushion
were presented by the late Mr. T. Tapling, carpet manufacturer,
of London, who was a native of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; In the centre
of the apse is a carved oak chair, having the monogram I.H.S.,
which was given by Mr. C. Blyton.&nbsp; In front, standing on the
Chapel floor, is a harmonium by Alexandre &amp; Sons, of Paris;
it is a fine instrument, having four sets of vibrators and 14
stops.&nbsp; It was obtained partly at the cost of the
congregation, and partly by a donation of the late Mr. John
Jobson, from Mr. Thomas Gunton (son of Mr. Richard Gunton of
London), who resided at Bunnyfield House, Hatfield Park, and was
for many years private secretary to the late Marquis of
Salisbury.&nbsp; The instrument originally cost &pound;84.&nbsp;
Mr. William Hall presided at this harmonium from the first.</p>
<p>We have mentioned Dr. Bayley of London as the earliest
preacher in the new chapel; there was no resident minister till
1902.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Hall <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>entertained
during the whole of the first year (1873) the preachers above
named.&nbsp; Others of note who followed were Mr. Layland of
Nottingham, Leader of the Society in 1876; followed,
1877&ndash;8, by Mr. J. R. Boyle; to whom succeeded,
1878&ndash;9, Mr. W. A. Bates (afterwards of Brisbane,
Queensland, Australia); Mr. W. J. Adcock, 1879&ndash;80; Mr. A.
E. Beilby, 1880&ndash;1; Mr. W. Hall, 1882; and Mr. William
Robinson, October of that year.&nbsp; At various dates the
preachers were Rev. R. Storey of Heywood near Manchester, Rev.
Mr. Wilkins of Nottingham, Mr. Skelton of London, Mr. Pulsford of
Leicester, Mr. Cameron of Edinburgh, Mr. Fairweather of London,
Mr. Ashby of Derby, Mr. Best of Hull, Rev. T. Prestland of
London, Rev. Joseph Deans in 1899, and Rev. J. R. Rendell,
President of the Conference; Rev. Lewis A. Slight of Northampton,
1900; Rev. J. T. Freeth of Bolton, President, 1901.&nbsp; From
time to time preachers were sent by the New Church Conference,
and later by the East Midland and Lincolnshire Association.</p>
<p>Three marriages were solemnized in the Chapel by Rev. L. A.
Slight, viz., that of Miss Townell and Mr W. Chapman of Oundle,
Dec. 11, 1900; Miss Elizabeth Hall and Mr. Edwin White, both of
Horncastle, May 21, 1901; and Miss Florence Smith to Mr. Alfred
Storton of London, July 9, 1901.</p>
<p>The Rev. Richard Mayes, the first resident Minister, came from
Leicester, first preached here Feb. 23, 1902, and entered on his
ministry in October of that year.&nbsp; Other preachers during
that interval were Mr. Fairweather of Loughborough, Mr. L. A.
Slight, Mr. Layland, Mr. W. Hall and Mr. H. Deans.</p>
<p>A Sunday School was opened with the Chapel in 1873; this was,
at a later date, temporarily closed, but re-opened by Mr.
Mayes.&nbsp; Under him, ably supported as he is by members the
Townell and Blyth families, and others, the services, which are
short, bright, and musical, are being attended by increasing
numbers.&nbsp; Mr. Edwin Townell is still Secretary, as he was in
1880; and with Mr. Mayes&rsquo; ministry Mr. H. Freeman succeeded
Mr. W. Hall as Treasurer.</p>
<h3>THE REV. THOMAS LORD.</h3>
<p>The subject of this notice, no longer holding a ministerial
charge, is by many years the doyen among Nonconformist preachers
in Horncastle, being the oldest Congregational Minister in
England.&nbsp; He completed his hundredth year on April 22, 1908;
on which occasion he received a congratulatory telegram from His
Majesty the King; while a public fund was instituted for a
presentation to be made to him in recognition of the occasion,
which he desired to be given in his name to the local Institution
of Nurses.</p>
<p>Mr. Lord was born at Olney, Bucks., in 1808; and began his
ministry in 1834, as pastor of a chapel at Wollaston, Northants,
which he held for eleven years; thence removing to Brigstock, in
the same county, where he laboured during 17 years.&nbsp; He
subsequently held pastorates in Horncastle, Deddington (Co.
Oxford), and Great Bridge, Staffordshire.&nbsp; He gave up
permanent charge in 1878, continuing, however, to assist other
ministers in that neighbourhood, until 1899, when, in consequence
of failing eyesight, he removed once more to Horncastle, taking
up his abode with his married daughter, Mrs. C. M. Hodgett, on
the Wong (No. 7).</p>
<p>Mr. Lord has been an active worker in the temperance cause
during more than 70 years; a member of the Liberation Society
since its formation; a warm advocate of the Peace Society, of the
United Kingdom Alliance; the <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>inaugural
meeting of which he attended at Manchester.&nbsp; He was one of
the founders of the Congregational Total Abstinence Association;
and has always been a warm supporter of the London Missionary
Society.</p>
<p>Mr. Lord still preaches occasionally in Horncastle.&nbsp; He
has officiated more than once recently in the Lincoln Mission
Hall, and not unfrequently occupies the pulpit at the
Presbyterian Chapel, Kirkstead, to assist the local minister,
Rev. Robert Holden, who is his junior by some 16 years.&nbsp; On
Sunday, May 31, 1908, Mr. Lord preached at Alford, in the
Congregational Chapel; and on Sunday, June 7, 1908, at Boston, in
the Chapel of the United Methodists.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his age Mr. Lord&rsquo;s voice is still clear,
deep-toned, and resonant; his manner is full of vigor, his
language simple, yet eloquent and earnest.&nbsp; His step is firm
and elastic.&nbsp; In habit he is an early riser.</p>

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.</h2>
<p>Having dealt with the places of worship in the town, we now
proceed to give an account of its schools; and among these the
Grammar School, from its antiquity, as well as for other reasons,
claims precedence.</p>
<p>This Institution, on its present foundation, dates from the
reign of Elizabeth, <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a> one of whose special
characteristics was her warm interest in education, which led her
to encourage her nobles, and more wealthy subjects, to promote
the cause.&nbsp; The Reformation had given an impetus towards
emancipation from the ignorance which prevailed in Popish times,
when the monasteries were almost the only centres of
enlightenment&mdash;if so it could be called.</p>
<p>Henry VIII. did little or nothing towards relighting the
torch, which had been held up by the monks, whom he
abolished.&nbsp; His successor, Edward VI., founded a few grammar
schools; among them being, in our own neighbourhood, those at
Spilsby, Louth, and Grantham.&nbsp; During the brief reign of the
Popish Mary, the movement was again checked; but Elizabeth,
herself a cultivated scholar, rekindled the general interest in
educational progress.</p>
<p>The title deeds of the school are unfortunately lost, which
would have shewn to what extent it was then endowed, but
documents exist belonging to the school, which prove the
conveyance of certain lands, by John Neale of Horncastle, in the
17th year of Elizabeth (A.D. 1575); he being one of the first 10
Governors appointed in accordance with the rules of the
foundation.</p>
<p>A useful little volume was published in 1894 by the late Dr.
Robert Jalland, then Senior Governor of the school, containing
its history, from the date of the Elizabethan foundation,
gathered from various documents and minute books, preserved in
the office of the Clerk of the Governors; from which we cull the
following particulars:</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>In the 13th year of her reign (1571), by Letters Patent
dated at Westminster, June 25, Elizabeth granted to her
&ldquo;well-beloved and faithful counsellor, and subject, Edward
Fynes, Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter, Lord Clinton
and Saye, High Admiral of England,&rdquo; that, at his prayer,
&ldquo;a Grammar School should be established in the town of
Horncastle, for the good education of boys and youths, living
there, and about the neighbouring parts, habitants and
comerants.&rdquo; <a name="citation92a"></a><a
href="#footnote92a" class="citation">[92a]</a>&nbsp; This was to
be called &ldquo;The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth, in
the Town and Soke of Horncastle of the foundation of (the said)
Edward, Lord Clynton,&rdquo; &amp;c., <a
name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b"
class="citation">[92b]</a> &ldquo;to continue for
ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to consist of &ldquo;a Master and
Sub-Master, or Usher,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;lands, tenements,
revenues, reversions, and other hereditaments, for the support of
the school, were granted, assigned, and appointed,&rdquo; for
their better management, &ldquo;to 10 discreet and honest men,
who (should) be styled Governors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first Governors appointed were Clement Monk, clerk; John
Smith, clerk; John Sackeverill, gent.; Thomas Litter, gent.; Geo.
Hargrave, gent.; Thos. Raithbecke, yeoman; John Neale, yeoman;
Thos. Hamerton, yeoman; Willm. Ward, yeoman; Willm. Harrison,
yeoman.&nbsp; They were constituted &ldquo;a body
corporate,&rdquo; having a &ldquo;common seal, to hold, to manage
the revenues of the school, and empowered to spend, and invest,
the income at their discretion,&rdquo; to appoint the teachers,
and successors in the governing body, as vacancies should, by
death, occur.</p>
<p>The property of the school, either from the original, or
later, <a name="citation92c"></a><a href="#footnote92c"
class="citation">[92c]</a> endowments, consists of lands,
tenements, ground and quit rents, in Horncastle, or in the
Wildmore Fen allotment of the same, land and tenement in
Hemingby, lands in Winthorpe, Huttoft, Sutton, and in Thornton a
payment of &pound;12 a year in lieu of former land, <a
name="citation92d"></a><a href="#footnote92d"
class="citation">[92d]</a> with certain moneys invested in
Government Consols and Indian Stock.</p>
<p>The rental of the school property has varied at various
periods.&nbsp; At the time of the civil war, when the
neighbourhood was more or less in a state of anarchy, there is no
record, for some years, of the Governors having even met to
dispense payments; and the Head Master&rsquo;s salary was only
&pound;10.&nbsp; In 1735 it amounted to &pound;42, and that of
the Usher to &pound;21; but in 1753 there was a reduction to
&pound;30 for the Head Master, and &pound;15 to the Usher, owing
to money having to be &ldquo;borrowed for the exigenceys of the
school.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1786 the income of the school rose to
&pound;529; the highest point which it seems ever to have
attained was &pound;877, in 1854.&nbsp; In that year the Head
Master&rsquo;s stipend is not specified, but two years later it
was &pound;235, with capitation fees amounting to &pound;251
odd.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>In 1780 the Head Master was the Rev. C. L&rsquo;Oste; he
was also Rector of Langton by Horncastle, and a good
scholar.&nbsp; He published a translation, in verse, of Grotius
on <i>The Christian Religion</i>.&nbsp; It was printed at the
Cambridge University Press, dedicated to the Bishop of Lincoln,
with a very distinguished list of subscribers. <a
name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; Differences arose between him and
the Governors, and in Sept., 1782, he was served with a notice to
quit, at the end of six months, for neglect of his duties.&nbsp;
He refused to give up office, counsel&rsquo;s opinion was taken
by the Governors, Mr. L&rsquo;Oste pleaded in his own
defence.&nbsp; The Governors gave notice of a trial at the
assizes.&nbsp; No result, however, is recorded, and Mr.
L&rsquo;Oste retained office until his death in 1818.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The year 1854 marked the close of the career of the most
remarkable Head Master who ever ruled the school.&nbsp; The Rev.
John Bainbridge Smith, D.D., had entered on his duties April 10,
1818, succeeding Mr. L&rsquo;Oste.&nbsp; Coming to the post as an
entirely unknown man, of comparatively humble origin, but of
great energy, he soon acquired a leading position in the town and
neighbourhood; becoming Rector of Martin, Rector of Sotby, and
Vicar of Baumber.&nbsp; He was the author of several standard
works on Divinity.&nbsp; Under him the school achieved such a
reputation that, besides the day scholars, he had a large number
of boarders coming from Scotland, Ireland, Devonshire, London,
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>and even Jersey and France.&nbsp; His end was
unfortunately as remarkable as his career.&nbsp; Returning by
train from Lincoln he fell asleep, and being roused at Kirkstead
by the porter giving the name of the station, and the night being
dark, he did not perceive that the train was again in motion, and
springing out of the carriage, he fell a few yards beyond the
platform and broke his neck.&nbsp; The porter found him lying
helpless, but alive, on the line.&nbsp; He was carefully conveyed
to his residence at Horncastle, and lingered alive several weeks,
retaining his mental faculties, but having no sense of feeling
below his neck.&nbsp; At length he recovered slight feeling in
his legs and feet, and probably tempted by this to make an effort
to move, he was found one morning dead in his bed.</p>
<p>The Duke of Newcastle, who owned property in Baumber (where,
as we have said, Dr. Smith was Incumbent), appointed him his
private chaplain; and the Doctor&rsquo;s youngest daughter, Sarah
Katherine, married the Rev. Henry Fiennes Clinton, a near
relative of the Duke, and a descendant of the founder of the
school, Lord Clinton and Saye.</p>
<p>The school building has not always occupied the site on which
it now stands.&nbsp; As shewn in Stukeley&rsquo;s plan of the
town, printed in 1722, it stood in the north-east corner of the
school yard.&nbsp; In 1772 that structure was found to be in a
ruinous condition, and the present building was erected, being
opened for use at Midsummer 1778.&nbsp; A classroom was added at
the south end in 1855, and more recently another small room put
up at the north end.&nbsp; The residence of the Head Master was
formerly a small low cottage, but it was considerably enlarged in
the early part of the 19th century, and in 1858 a new wing was
added at the north end.</p>
<p>In 1847 two &ldquo;Clinton&rdquo; Exhibitions were founded by
the Governors, of &pound;50 a year, to be held for four years, by
scholars going to the University.&nbsp; For lack of such scholars
this was granted to Clement Madely Smith, youngest son of Dr.
Smith, the Head Master, who studied for the medical profession,
in London.&nbsp; No further appointment however was made, as in
1848 the Governors decided that they had no authority so to
employ the funds at their disposal.</p>
<p>On the death of Dr. Smith, in 1854, a new scheme of education,
more suited to the requirements of the time, was drawn up by a
committee appointed for that purpose, which received the sanction
of the Charity Commissioners, and was approved by the Master of
the Rolls in the same year.</p>
<p>The attendance at the school, however, gradually fell off,
until, in the year 1886, there were only 16 scholars; and further
reforms were needed.&nbsp; Since then changes in the system have,
from time to time, been introduced, to render the school more
generally useful: the more recent being the admission of female
pupils in 1903, for whom was appointed a resident lady teacher,
Miss E. Gibson, who had matriculated, 1st class, at London
University.</p>
<p>Small Scholarships also, not exceeding six in number, were
established for needy pupils; and application was made to the
Lindsey County Council, for a grant of &pound;80, in aid of
scientific lectures, <a name="citation94"></a><a
href="#footnote94" class="citation">[94]</a> under the Technical
Instruction Act of Parliament; so that a general middle-class
English education was provided, along with Latin, French,
book-keeping, and other technical subjects; an examination being
held annually by some one unconnected with the school, who should
be approved of by the Charity Commissioners.&nbsp; The school has
thus, under the tenure of the Head Mastership by Dr. Madge, of
late years, <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>been considerably improved, and the
area of the subjects taught, widened; assisted as he has been by
the able Second Master, Mr. C. W. Gott, B.A., London, and Miss
Gibson.&nbsp; But it has also been increasingly recognised that
there was room for still further development, if the institution
was to take its proper position among the endowed educational
establishments of the county.&nbsp; This, however, is a subject
to which we shall recur hereafter.</p>
<p>In 1855 a school Library was commenced, the Governors granting
&pound;10 for the purchase of books; &pound;20 being given in the
following year, and this has been further enlarged in later
years, until the books now number nearly 500.</p>
<p>In March, 1893, a Magazine entitled <i>Banovallum</i> was
established, to be mainly carried on by the scholars, the Editor
being J. G. Meanwell, Sub-Editor J. R. Cowburn.&nbsp; It was a
monthly record of school work and sports, with various other
matters of interest.&nbsp; It was intended also to be a link of
connection between &ldquo;old boys&rdquo; and new; and with this
view former pupils of the school were invited to contribute. <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a>&nbsp; The outside support, however, of
such a publication was not sufficient to render it a paying
venture, and after an existence of rather more than two years, it
expired with the July No. of 1895.</p>
<p>Here we may fittingly introduce some personal reminiscences of
the school, and those connected with it, in its palmiest days,
under the regime of Dr. Smith, and first we may mention members
of his own family.</p>
<p>Although, as before stated, himself of humble origin, <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a> he married the daughter of a General
Sandwith, a lady who was highly esteemed by all who knew
her.&nbsp; She bore him three sons and three daughters, and
predeceased him.&nbsp; His eldest son, Bainbridge, graduated at
Cambridge University, took Holy Orders, was at one time English
Chaplain at Smyrna, and succeeded his father in the Rectory of
Sotby.&nbsp; He married a daughter of Judge Haliburton of Nova
Scotia, the author of <i>Sam Slick</i>, <i>The Watchmaker</i>
(1839) and other works, which were popular in their day.&nbsp;
The eldest daughter, Frances, married a member of a then
well-known Horncastle family, the Rev. John Fawssett, a graduate
of Cambridge, who afterwards became in turn Rector of Minting and
Vicar of Baumber with Stourton.&nbsp; A second son, Joseph
Coltman, became a Solicitor in Hull, but died early in
life.&nbsp; A second daughter, Isabella, married the Rev. W.
Affleck Peacock (named after his relative Sir Robert Affleck, of
Dalham Hall, Newmarket), Rector of Ulceby near Alford.&nbsp; The
youngest daughter, as already stated, married the Rev. Henry
Fiennes Clinton, Rector of Cromwell, near Newark, a near relative
of the Duke of Newcastle, to whom he was appointed domestic
Chaplain.&nbsp; The third and youngest son, Clement Madely, so
named after his godfather, the esteemed former Vicar of
Horncastle, adopted the medical profession and went out to India,
where he became known as a keen sportsman among big game; a group
of two tigers shot by him, and stuffed by Ward the great
taxidermist, being exhibited in the Crystal Palace several years
ago.</p>
<p>Of the scholars at the school, under Dr. Smith, we recall a
few names, as samples of the class of pupils whom he
received.&nbsp; There were three Sandwiths, Humphrey, Godfrey,
and Henry, who were his nephews on his wife&rsquo;s side.&nbsp;
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Humphrey became a surgeon, and having a taste for
foreign travel, went out to Constantinople to practice
there.&nbsp; Having good introductions he was kindly received by
Sir Stratford Canning, the English Ambassador, and making the
acquaintance of Layard, he was invited to travel with him to
Mecca, Mosul, and Nineveh, at two of which places excavations
were conducted; as Hakim, or Doctor, he was visited by crowds of
Arabs, suffering from various ailments; and his quinine wrought
wonderful cures among them.&nbsp; When at home he sometimes
surprised his friends by suddenly appearing among them dressed in
Arab costume.&nbsp; In 1855 he was at the famous siege of Kars,
under General Fenwick Williams; when a force of 15,000 English
were shut in by an army of 50,000 Russians.&nbsp; The English had
three months&rsquo; provisions and three days&rsquo; ammunition;
they suffered greatly from cholera, and after five months
surrendered, only when overcome by famine.&nbsp; Humphrey wrote a
history of the siege.</p>
<p>Of Godfrey we remember little; Henry graduated at Cambridge,
took Holy Orders and became Vicar of Thorpe Salvin, near
Worksop.&nbsp; There were three Inveraritys, Duncan, Henry, and
William; the first of these went out to India, and became a Judge
in the Supreme Sudder Court.&nbsp; Henry devoted himself to
yachting, and died early.&nbsp; William held a commission in a
Highland Regiment of foot.&nbsp; Roseville Brackenbury, whose
father, a former Peninsular officer, and member of an old
Lincolnshire family, resided temporarily at Horncastle, in order
to place his son under Dr. Smith, entered the East India
Company&rsquo;s service, in the Bengal Presidency.</p>
<p>There were three Buchanans, sons of an old Indian officer,
Major Buchanan, a Scotchman, but residing in Maida Vale,
London.&nbsp; These were James, Alexander, and Robert.&nbsp;
James was a dashing, chivalrous, high-spirited fellow, who took
service in a Madras regiment of cavalry; his brother
&ldquo;Alick&rdquo; was of a different fibre, being chiefly
remarkable for the amount of treacle tarts which he could
consume, at the shop of the once well-known &ldquo;Sally
Dickinson;&rdquo; the third brother, Robert, entered the
navy.</p>
<p>We may here mention, as evidence of the hard work which was
done under Dr. Smith&rsquo;s system, a feat of memory performed
by two brothers among the senior boys, Thomas and Alfred Cammack,
which the present writer well remembers, as he was present as a
small boy when it occurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Repetition,&rdquo; of
one kind or another, was required of all boys; but these two
repeated to the Master from memory, the whole of the first book
of Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i> (798 lines), Thomas with
only three promptings, and Alfred with five.&nbsp; Another boy,
Sidney Bousfield, did the same with nine or ten promptings.&nbsp;
Thomas Cammack walked his hospital in London, and eventually
became a consulting physician of some eminence, residing at
Boston; Alfred died early.&nbsp; Sydney Bousfield went out to
India, and died some years ago.</p>
<p>Two pupils, Holland and Forge, who came to study with the
Doctor, of more mature years than the ordinary scholars, were
&ldquo;crack shots,&rdquo; and welcomed at many of the shooting
parties in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; A third, Frank Richardson,
who was an ardent fox hunter, had his horse brought to the door
weekly, on the day when the meet was nearest, and was always
among the foremost in the field.&nbsp; He was, further, a great
athlete, and would follow the hounds on foot, and not seldom be
in at two deaths in the day, several miles apart; of him, it is
related, that he leapt the school-yard wall, nearly 7-ft.
high.&nbsp; There were many more who were trained by the Doctor
to serve their generation worthily in various capacities, but let
these suffice as a sample of his influence.</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>The Under Masters whose services he enlisted were,
further, not unworthy of him.&nbsp; We will name one or two.</p>
<p>The first Under Master of whom the present writer has any
knowledge was Thomas Myddelton.&nbsp; He was by birth a
gentleman, being connected with the very old family of the
Myddelton Biddulphs of Chirk Castle, North Wales, who have now
dropped the latter name, retaining only the Myddelton.&nbsp;
Thomas Myddelton&rsquo;s father, John M. (then dead), had been
Rector of Bucknall, in this neighbourhood, 1804&ndash;34; his
grandfather, also named Thomas, having been Vicar of Melton
Mowbray; he (John M.) having been an Exhibitioner of St.
Paul&rsquo;s School, London, graduated B.A. at Sidney Sussex
College, Cambridge, 1782, and gained a Fellowship.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

src="images/p97s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Thomas also graduated at Sidney Sussex College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; While serving as Under Master at the Grammar
School he was ordained to the Curacy of Bucknall, under his
father&rsquo;s successor, the Rev. John Fendall.&nbsp; On the
occasion of his ordination he begged a whole holiday of Dr.
Smith, and treated the whole school to a day at Tattershall
Castle; hiring carriages to take them all, there being yet no
railway; and he gave them a substantial meal at the
&ldquo;Fortescue Arms&rdquo; Hotel.&nbsp; He was naturally very
popular with the boys of the school, although he was rather a
strict disciplinarian, and made them work hard.&nbsp; He was
commemorated in the &ldquo;Breaking up Song&rdquo; of the school
in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Myddelton now comes in,<br />
With his nose above his chin; (two prominent features)<br />
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>With pleasant smile he waves his cane,<br />
As though to say, &ldquo;I would fain refrain;<br />
It grieves me sore to give a thwack<br />
Upon the shrinking truant&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<span
class="smcap">chorus</span>)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re breaking up, and going away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All for the sake of a holiday.<br />
Jack&rsquo;s a dull boy without his play;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Hurrah, again, for a holiday!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He remained at the Grammar School about two years, afterwards
taking the Curacy of Langton with Wildsworth, near
Gainsborough.&nbsp; He presently moved to West Stockwith, holding
the Curacy of Wildsworth with East Ferry.&nbsp; He never held a
benefice; but, having some private means, he continued to reside,
in retirement, at West Stockwith, until his decease, about
1880.&nbsp; He was buried at Misterton, the adjoining parish,
where he had also taken occasional duty.</p>
<p>After Mr. Myddelton the next Under Master was William
Hutchinson.&nbsp; He was the son of the landlord of the principal
inn in the neighbouring town of Wragby, and had been educated at
the small grammar school there.&nbsp; He was appointed about
1845.&nbsp; He graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, as B.A., in
1848, keeping his terms there by permission, while acting as
Usher at Horncastle.&nbsp; In that year he left Horncastle, and
was elected Master of Howden Grammar School in Yorkshire, where
he was also appointed Curate in 1848, being ordained Deacon in
1848 and Priest in 1849.&nbsp; While at Horncastle he had married
Miss Caroline Dixon, daughter of a corn merchant; there were five
daughters, all clever, the youngest being Miss Annie Dixon, who
became distinguished as a miniature painter, exhibiting in the
Royal Academy, and becoming a favourite of the late Queen
Victoria.&nbsp; He held the Head Mastership at Howden for several
years; holding also the Perpetual Curacy of Laxton near Howden
from 1850 to 1855, the Perpetual Curacy or Vicarage of Airmyn
from 1855 to 1862, when he was appointed Vicar of Howden, which
benefice he held till his death in 1903.</p>
<p>It was somewhat remarkable that he began professional life in
Horncastle, famed for its great horse fairs, and passed the rest
of his life at Howden, also noted for its great horse fair.&nbsp;
His wife is buried, with two sisters, in the cemetery at
Horncastle.</p>
<p>The next Under Master to be mentioned about this period was
Francis Grosvenor.&nbsp; He was the son of a respectable
tradesman in the town, and had been educated at the Grammar
School.&nbsp; At first he was employed by Dr. Smith as a
supernumerary teacher of the junior boys, and became useful in
the temporary absences of Mr. Hutchinson, at Dublin
University.&nbsp; He was a conscientious and dependable youth,
thoughtful beyond his years, and was much valued by the Head
Master, who was a shrewd judge of character.&nbsp; He also
graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, taking honours; and was
ordained Deacon in 1847, and Priest in 1848.&nbsp; He remained as
Second Master for some years at the Grammar School, being much
esteemed among neighbouring clergy for his unostentatious manners
and general worth.&nbsp; He frequently officiated in the Parish
Church.&nbsp; Eventually he went to Chester, as Curate of St.
John&rsquo;s Church in that city, where he remained many years,
taking pupils.&nbsp; There was probably a talismanic attraction
in the name of Grosvenor; Eaton Hall, the seat of Lord Grosvenor
(now Duke of Westminster) being in the immediate vicinity.&nbsp;
He was consequently very successful in obtaining pupils; <!--
page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>and made money, whereby he acquired considerable house
property there and elsewhere.&nbsp; He was devoted to
arch&aelig;ological pursuits, and published a learned paper (of
16 pp.) on &ldquo;The early connection between the County
Palatine of Chester and the Principality of Wales,&rdquo; which
he read before the County Antiquarian Society. <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a>&nbsp; After many years&rsquo;
residence in Chester, he retired on a competency to Epsom, in
Surrey, where his mother, brother and sister resided with him;
and where he acted as Chaplain to the Union, until his decease,
about 1880.</p>
<p>The last Assistant Master, under Dr. Smith, whom we may name
was John Burton, born of humble parents in Peterborough.&nbsp; He
was appointed about 1848, and served Dr. Smith faithfully about
three years.&nbsp; He was not, however, a strong man, either
physically or mentally.&nbsp; His weakness of character was shewn
in an incident which might have had a tragic termination.&nbsp;
Having formed an attachment for a young lady, living near the
schoolhouse, and being rejected, he declared that he would commit
suicide; and he fired off a pistol under her window at night,
taking care, however, not to wound himself.&nbsp; On leaving the
school he entered at Jesus College, Cambridge, and graduated in
1853, dying soon afterwards.</p>
<p>On the appointment of the Rev. Samuel Lodge, to the Head
Mastership in 1854, Thomas White, a graduate of St. John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, became Under Master.&nbsp; He had taken
classical honours, and was an efficient teacher, and rather
strict disciplinarian.&nbsp; He was the first Under Master
allowed to take private pupils as boarders.&nbsp; He continued at
his post six years, taking Holy Orders, and in 1860 was presented
by the Bishop of Lincoln to the Vicarage of Scamblesby, which he
held until his death in 1891.</p>
<p>It may be of interest if we here give some of the customs of
the school at this period, as samples of a state of things which
is now past and gone.&nbsp; The morality of some of them might be
questioned in these days of advanced ideas on civilization, but,
under the guidance of a man of Dr. Smith&rsquo;s mental calibre,
their effect was the rearing of a generation of manly youths,
capable of much intellectual, as well as physical, activity and
endurance.</p>
<p>The Head Master was himself a remarkable instance of
this.&nbsp; Punctually at 7.30, without fail, he was every
morning in his desk at the school, to open proceedings with
prayer, it being frequently a race between himself and his
boarder pupils, as to who should arrive first, his residence
being some quarter mile from the school.&nbsp; When he closed the
school, with &ldquo;abire licet,&rdquo; <a
name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a> in the afternoon, he as regularly went
for his &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo; walk.&nbsp; Furious indeed
must be the weather if Dr. Smith was not to be seen on Langton
Hill, summer and winter, rain or fair; if the former he would
brave the elements, wrapt in a large blue cloth cloak, waterproof
as his leather gaiters.&nbsp; If the latter, he would often
saunter slowly, rapt in meditation, or composing verses, an
occupation of which he was very fond, leaving behind him at his
death several vols. of MS. poetry. <a name="citation99c"></a><a
href="#footnote99c" class="citation">[99c]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>The school hours were from 7.30 to 9, before breakfast;
10 to 12.30 midday; afternoon 3 to 5; while the boarders at his
own house worked with the Assistant Master from 7 to 9; the day
boys, in the town, preparing exercises and repetition for the
next morning, at their own homes.&nbsp; It was an amusement, for
some of the more active, to get up some quarter of an hour
earlier than the others, and hurry down to St. Mary&rsquo;s
Church, to help old Dawson, the sexton, to ring the Grammar
School bell. <a name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a>&nbsp; As the Doctor was very active
in his movements, any boarders who were late in starting, could
only reach the school in time, by running across the fields
between the two branches of the canal, called &ldquo;The
Holms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Woe betide those who were late!</p>
<p>From the Doctor&rsquo;s energy of character it would be
expected that he would encourage active healthy
recreations.&nbsp; The days of cricket were not yet, <a
name="citation100b"></a><a href="#footnote100b"
class="citation">[100b]</a> although &ldquo;single wicket&rdquo;
was sometimes practiced.&nbsp; Nor was football popular, as it is
now.&nbsp; The game was indeed played, but we had, in those days,
no Rugby rules, and the ball was composed of a common bladder,
with a leather cover made by the shoemaker.&nbsp; In the school
yard the chief game was &ldquo;Prisoner&rsquo;s Base,&rdquo;
generally played by boarders against day boys; in this swiftness
of foot was specially valuable.&nbsp; There was also a game named
&ldquo;Lasty,&rdquo; in which one boy was selected to stand at
the upper end of the yard, while the rest gathered at the lower
end.&nbsp; After a short interval, the one boy darted forward
towards the others, who all tried to avoid him; his object was to
catch one of the other boys, and when he succeeded in this, the
boy whom he caught took up the running to catch another, and this
could go on for any length of time.&nbsp; There was another
exciting game called &ldquo;Lug and a Bite.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
fruit season a day boarder, from the country, frequently brought
his pocket full of apples; he would throw an apple among the
other boys, one of whom would catch it, and run away biting it;
the others would chase him, and seize him by the lug (ear), when
he would throw it away, and another would catch it, and continue
the process, he being, in his turn, caught by the ear, and so
on.&nbsp; This afforded much amusement, and many apples would in
this way be consumed.&nbsp; There were large slabs of stone laid
down in the yard, on which marbles were played with, and peg tops
were spun.&nbsp; Hockey, or shinty, as it was commonly called,
was also a favourite game; but these amusements were chiefly
confined to the sons of tradesmen in the town.</p>
<p>Among the boarders archery was practised, and by some of them
with a skill almost rivalling that of Locksley in Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s novel of <i>Ivanhoe</i>.&nbsp; A carpenter in the
town made for us bows of lancewood, and arrows of poplar, tipped
with spikes of iron.&nbsp; With these we could not only split our
&ldquo;willow wand&rdquo; at 80 yards distant, but the more
skilful deemed an arrow hardly worth having until it had been
baptized in the blood of blackbird or pigeon, and some of the
neighbouring pigeon cotes suffered accordingly.&nbsp; The writer
was presented with a bow made of bamboo, and arrows said to be
poisoned, which a great traveller, then residing in Horncastle,
had brought from the South Sea Islands.&nbsp; He lent these to a
brother archer, who by mistake shot another boy in the calf of
the leg.&nbsp; Great alarm was the result, but the poison must
have lost its power, for no evil consequences ensued, except that
the wounded party almost frightened himself into a state of
fever.</p>

101</span>These, however, were among the less hardy of our
sports.&nbsp; The good old Doctor&rsquo;s great aim was to get us
healthily engaged in the country.&nbsp; With this object he would
say on a Monday morning to the bigger boys of the two highest
classes, &ldquo;Now, lads, if you will translate this book of
Virgil, or Homer, or this Greek play, as quickly as you can, you
shall have the rest of the week to spend as you
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; Put upon our mettle by such a challenge the
work would be completed, by us perhaps on the Wednesday, and
three days of varied enjoyment in country rambles would
follow.&nbsp; In these days, when bird-nesting is forbidden as
being &ldquo;cruelty to animals,&rdquo; it may horrify some of
our readers to learn that the Doctor encouraged his pupils to
collect eggs.&nbsp; On our excursions in early summer every hedge
was carefully examined for many miles round, the tallest trees
were climbed, or, as it was then called &ldquo;swarmed,&rdquo; in
search of the eggs of hawk, carrion crow, woodpecker, &amp;c.;
those of the <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>owl were found in the thick fir
plantations, or those of the jackdaw in old ruins; the rarest
specimens being presented to the Doctor himself, while commoner
kinds were hung in festoons from the ceiling of our study at his
residence.&nbsp; The two chief holidays at this season were the
Queen&rsquo;s Birthday, May 24th, and &ldquo;Royal Oak
Day,&rdquo; May 29th.&nbsp; On these two days the boys were
expected to decorate the school in the early hours of the
morning; a <i>sine qua non</i> being, that, on the Doctor&rsquo;s
arrival at 7.30 a.m., he should find his desk so filled with
floral and arboreal adornments, that he could not enter it;
whereat he would make the remark, repeated annually, &ldquo;Well,
boys! you have shut me out of my desk, so we must give up work
for the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also, on these occasions, often
brought with him a daughter, and the two carefully looked into
the decorated desk, when they were rewarded by finding the nest
and eggs of a &ldquo;feather-poke&rdquo; (long-tailed tit), or
some other rare bird, which he always took home and preserved in
his study, as a trophy till the following year.&nbsp; No
questions were asked as to <i>how</i> the decorations were
obtained, but in practice the process was as follows.&nbsp; On
the day before, between school hours, certain of the younger boys
were sent round the town to beg flowers, and then, later on,
followed what, as we should have said, the present hypercritical
generation would call, at the very least, &ldquo;dishonest
pilfering.&rdquo;&nbsp; After retiring to rest, and when the
final visit of the Assistant Master had been made to the
dormitories, all became excitement; boots and caps had been
carefully concealed under the beds.&nbsp; The elder boys were
quickly re-clothed, booted and bonneted; and we crept down, by
back stairs, to the kitchen, with the connivance of the cook and
housekeeper; those good souls also providing some refreshment for
us, to be taken either before we went out, or after we returned;
and then, stealthily emerging by the back door, we separated into
small companies of twos and threes; some re-visiting gardens in
the town, and taking without permission further flowers; others
going into the country; sometimes even taking a light cart from
one yard and a pony or horse from another, and then visiting
gardens or parks in the neighbourhood, and returning laden with
branches of horse-chesnut flowers, pink may, &amp;c., which were
quietly conveyed to the school; and by the appointed hour the
work of decoration would be completed; and we, having returned to
our dormitories, refreshed through the cook&rsquo;s kindness the
inner man, and washed the outer, were ready to greet the good
Doctor and his daughter on their arrival.&nbsp; The only
difference between the decorations on the 24th and 29th was, that
on the latter day oak leaves and acorns were a distinguishing
feature, some of the sprays having been gilded on the previous
day for presentation to the young lady.</p>
<p>There was another great day called the
&ldquo;Treasurer&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once a year the
one of the Governors, who held that office, was entitled to ask
the Head Master to give us a whole holiday, which he was always
pleased to grant.&nbsp; The custom was for one of the senior boys
to call upon, or write to, the Treasurer, usually after some
period of extra hard scholastic work, asking him to exercise this
privilege.&nbsp; The way in which these holidays were spent
varied.&nbsp; Sometimes we had a &ldquo;Paper Chase,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Fox and Hounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; One boy was sent out as fox,
sometimes accompanied by another boy, both carrying in bags a
supply of paper, torn into small shreds, which formed the
scent.&nbsp; In this sport the Doctor sometimes offered a reward
of five shillings to the &ldquo;fox&rdquo; who should manage to
elude his pursuers until he had reached the bank of the river
Witham, a distance of about six miles, but increased to 10 or
more miles <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>by the different ruses practised to
escape capture; a similar reward being offered to the
&ldquo;hound&rdquo; who should effect his capture after a run of
a stipulated number of miles.</p>
<p>Sometimes we had a picnic to the Tower-on-the-Moor, going
there on foot, through &ldquo;the Wilderness,&rdquo; and other
woods, and having our luncheon brought to the Tower in the
carrier&rsquo;s cart, which passed daily on its way to Kirkstead
wharf.&nbsp; This was usually a bird-nesting excursion.&nbsp;
More than one of us accomplished the hazardous feat of climbing
to the top of the tower, whence a fine view could be obtained, on
a favourable day, across the Wash into Norfolk.&nbsp; On one of
these occasions we extended our ramble to Kirkstead wharf, some
adventurous spirits took forcible possession of the ferry boat,
and carried over women returning home, with their marketings,
free of charge.&nbsp; The owner of the boat was, however,
compensated by our calling at his small hostel close by, and
patronising his lemonade, bread and cheese.&nbsp; Sometimes the
excursion was to Tattershall Castle, and if this was in the
winter we skated there in the morning, along the canal, returning
on our &ldquo;runners&rdquo; by moonlight; the Doctor being
himself a good skater, encouraged it in his boys.&nbsp; On these
occasions we sometimes amused ourselves on the return journey by
firing pistols, to disturb the inhabitants of houses near the
canal; when, if anyone put his head out of a bedroom window, some
one of us would shout, &ldquo;your money or your life;&rdquo; the
usual response being &ldquo;Go along, ye bulldogs,&rdquo; the
name by which we were commonly known throughout the country
side.</p>
<p>On one of these return journeys, while skating in single file,
we approached the third lock, and the boy in front forgetting
that there would be no ice for a few yards below the lock,
because the water there was kept in agitation by the stream
always falling from the lock, suddenly found himself floundering
in an icy cold bath, while himself in a state of great
heat.&nbsp; The shock, and the fact that he was cumbered by his
skates, made him almost helpless, and he would probably have been
drowned, but that a fine fellow (I give his name, Edward Sharpe,
for he has long ago put &ldquo;off this mortal coil&rdquo;), who
was a great athlete, plunged in, skates and all, regardless of
the risk, and like a Newfoundland dog, panting brought his friend
to shore, with no worse effects than the drenching to both.&nbsp;
And here I may say that one of the accomplishments specially
encouraged by the Doctor was that of swimming; the very youngest
were taught to swim by the Under Master, in a small pool in the
river Bain, called &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Hole,&rdquo; about 100
yards from the first lock of the canal.&nbsp; After gaining
proficiency we bathed in the canal and lockpit itself.&nbsp; The
Doctor gave a reward of 5/- to any boy who could dive across the
canal, the same sum when he could swim 100 yards on his back.</p>
<p>On one occasion a bully, among the bigger boys, threw a timid
little fellow into the lockpit when full, saying &ldquo;Now,
you&rsquo;ll learn to swim, or sink.&rdquo;&nbsp; The little
fellow did sink, rose to the surface, and sank again; and would
certainly have been drowned, but a shout from other indignant
youngsters, looking helplessly on, brought the same Edward Sharpe
to the rescue (he was bathing below the lock, not aware of what
was going on), and he at once plunged into the lock, dived to the
bottom (18 or 20 feet), and brought up the poor half-conscious
boy, who would otherwise have perished.</p>
<p>It may here be mentioned that the present writer once swam
from the junction of the two branches of the canal (close to the
present bathing place) to the first lock, then passed on and swam
to the second, and so continuing, swam to the third lock, his
clothes being carried by a school fellow who <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>accompanied
him; this being a distance of some two miles, for this the Doctor
rewarded him with 10/- and a whole holiday.&nbsp; He also, it may
be added, as a reckless feat, when bathing, leapt stark naked
across the first lock; a performance which the slightest slip
might have made fatal.</p>
<p>Many are the anecdotes which could be here told of our
adventures; as of policemen or keepers eluded, or put off the
scent, by various ruses, &amp;c., &amp;c., on our various
marauding expeditions, but I will mention only two more
incidents.</p>
<p>From the same feelings of jealousy, doubtless, which produce
the &ldquo;Town and Gown&rdquo; antagonism at the University,
there was much ill-feeling among the lower class of boys in the
town towards ourselves, and free fights occasionally occurred
between them and the hated &ldquo;bull-dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; At dusk
stones were thrown at us, which it was difficult to avoid in the
then badly lighted streets.&nbsp; Sudden sorties were made from
alleys, to take us unawares, and send us sprawling on the
coggles.&nbsp; Especially in snowy weather we were assailed with
snowballs on our way from school to the Doctor&rsquo;s house, and
although we stood shoulder to shoulder and made a spirited
resistance, it not uncommonly occurred that these missiles were
(doubtless purposely) made to contain a piece of ice, or even a
sharp flint.&nbsp; In one of these skirmishes the writer himself
was struck on the temple, his eye only just escaping, by a
snowball, which a comrade picked up, on seeing that the wound was
bleeding, and a fragment of glass was found inside it; this,
surely, an extreme illustration of the principle that &ldquo;all
is lawful in war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One great event, of yearly re-occurrence, was our bonfire with
fireworks, on the 5th of November.&nbsp; Pocket money was hoarded
up several weeks beforehand, to provide for the latter; some boys
even made their own squibs and crackers, and these were
considerably larger and more formidable than those which were
bought.&nbsp; The scene was usually a field on Langton Hill,
which belonged to the school.&nbsp; Subscriptions were raised to
purchase 100 faggots, locally called &ldquo;kids;&rdquo; but here
again our custom would, in strictness, have been condemned, for,
in addition to the purchased fuel, for sometime beforehand, we
had been searching the hedges around, armed with axes, and so had
got together probably as much to which we had no right, as that
which had been bought.&nbsp; The bonfire was thus doubled in
size, and made a blaze which, on the hill, would be seen for many
a mile.&nbsp; We had a whole holiday to give us time to pile up
the heap; and in the evening parents and many other friends
crowded to the field as spectators.&nbsp; Sometimes a lighted
balloon or two, of varied colours, would be sent up, which were
watched by the bright eyes of sisters and cousins, until they
were lost in the distance.</p>
<p>At length the conflagration was reduced to smouldering ashes,
and all retired; but on our way back to the school house there
were often rough doings, between the town boys and bull-dogs;
free vent was given to spite, and a broken or bruised head, or
body, might be the result; but we made no complaint; as loyal
subjects we had done our duty in protesting against all such
underhand doings as &ldquo;Gunpowder Plot;&rdquo; and, after a
hearty supper, given by our kind Head Master, we enjoyed the
rest, well earned by the exertions and trials of the day.</p>
<p>We have now said enough of the school, its institutions and
customs, under a regime which has passed away, doubtless never to
return; <i>tempora mutantur</i>.</p>
<p>Of the modern school we may here say that it is now doing
useful work, <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>although with a different class of
pupils to those above referred to; and in the near future, it is
hoped, that further changes will give it a still higher position
in educational work.&nbsp; Under Dr. A. G. Madge, who retired and
accepted church preferment in 1907, the school was made to meet
the requirements of the Oxford and Cambridge local examinations,
the London University Matriculation, and the South Kensington
Science and Art Departments.</p>
<p>In late years boys from the school have filled posts in
various parts of the world with credit.&nbsp; A considerable
number have obtained clerkships in banks, or in the Civil
Service; one boy, Richard Gordon Healey, passed 7th among more
than a hundred candidates for the General Post Office service,
London, and is now in the excise service.&nbsp; Another,
Fairburn, is Assistant Inspector of Police at Singapore.&nbsp;
Another, Isle, is a Civil Engineer, and has taken the B.Sc.
degree.&nbsp; A summary of successes at the school, kindly
supplied to the writer by Dr. Madge, shows that in the last seven
years (1906) five boys have passed the London University
Matriculation, 19 the Cambridge local examination, 34 the South
Kensington examination, while four have qualified for the public
Civil Service; a creditable result for a town of the size of
Horncastle.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A recent change has been the admission of pupil teachers to
classes specially adapted to their requirements, and with this
accession to the numbers receiving instruction, there are now
more pupils in the school, male and female together, than at any
period within the last 30 years.</p>
<p>The latest changes, in the direction of progress, have been as
follows: A new governing body has been created by the Board of
Education, consisting of 13 members; the Lord of the Manor, the
Honble. R. Stanhope, being <i>ex officio</i> one of them; eight
representative Governors holding office for three years; two
being appointed by the Lindsey County Council, three (one of them
a female) by the Urban Council, two by the Guardians, one by the
Justices of the Peace at the Lindsey Quarter Sessions.&nbsp;
There are also four co-optative Governors (among them one female
at least), appointed by the Governors for five years.&nbsp; It is
further ordered that the Head Master need not be in Holy Orders;
under which rule has been appointed the present Head Master, Mr.
Arthur N. Worman, B.A., London, late Assistant Master at King
Edward VII. Grammar School, King&rsquo;s Lynn, who was selected
by the Governors from 150 candidates for the post.</p>
<h3><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Addendum I.</h3>
<p>It will have been observed that we have so far adopted the
prevalent nomenclature, and spoken of this school as an
Elizabethan institution, founded in 1571.&nbsp; It must now be
added that, venerable as that date of origin would make it, it
has a higher claim to our veneration still.&nbsp; <i>Vixere
fortes ante Agamemnona</i>.&nbsp; There were grammar schools
before that date.&nbsp; Edward VI. is said to have established
several, in various parts of the country, and we have already
named two such in our own neighbourhood, viz., those of Spilsby
and Louth; but it is now known that even these were, strictly
speaking, revivals of still other institutions.&nbsp; It is now
known that not a few of the charities, or public institutions,
supposed to have been founded by Queen Elizabeth, were really of
older date, but revived, confirmed, or augmented, under her wise
rule.&nbsp; In a published account of the old grammar school of
Giggleswick, Yorkshire, <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a> commonly reputed
to be a foundation of Edward VI., is the following statement,
&ldquo;a large number of schools bear the name of Ed. VI., who
undoubtedly desired to strengthen the grammar school
system.&nbsp; His good intentions were, however, frustrated by
the Commissioners; and very few of the so-called Edward VI.
grammar schools had their origin in his reign, being older
foundations with a new name.&rdquo; <a name="citation106b"></a><a
href="#footnote106b" class="citation">[106b]</a></p>
<p>It seems certain that Horncastle Grammar School is an
analogous case.&nbsp; Documents have recently been brought to
light in the archives of the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln, which
prove that, acting for the Chancellor (who was <i>ex officio</i>
&ldquo;Magister Scholarum&rdquo;), during a temporary vacancy of
that office, they appointed Masters to the grammar schools of
Boston, Partney, Horncastle, and elsewhere, in the year 1329; the
Horncastle Master, so appointed, being one John of
Beverley.&nbsp; This mode of appointment being exceptional, was
only to be valid for one year; but the Chancellorship continuing
vacant, the Masters were confirmed in their positions by the Dean
and Chapter, in the following year 1330, and again in 1331; and
so on, in successive years. <a name="citation106c"></a><a
href="#footnote106c" class="citation">[106c]</a></p>
<p>Now this mode of appointment being only in lieu of appointment
by the Chancellor, while his office was in abeyance, it follows
that these schools were in existence, as public institutions
under the Chancellor, before the dates named.&nbsp; Although,
therefore, we are unable to fix the exact period of the
school&rsquo;s existence, it may be satisfactory for
Horncastrians to know that, in addition to the various
interesting associations which we have already given as connected
with the school, there is proof that before Shakespeare had
composed one of his immortal plays, before Spenser had written a
line of his <i>Faerie Queen</i>, before Bacon had even thought of
his <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, there had existed a
&ldquo;seat of learning&rdquo; in the small provincial town of
Horncastle, which had then attained to the respectable age of
more than two centuries.</p>
<p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>We have been accustomed to consider the foundation of
William of Wykeham, at Winchester, in 1373, as one at least of
our very oldest, but Horncastle Grammar School may even be of
still earlier date than that.&nbsp; The oldest school of all is
King&rsquo;s School, Canterbury, attributed to Archbishop
Theodore, A.D. 670, but which may probably be traced to St.
Augustine.&nbsp; St. Peter&rsquo;s School, York, is the next
oldest.</p>
<h3>Addendum II.</h3>
<p>The Governors of the Grammar School are about to erect, in
this year, 1908, new and more commodious premises for the school,
in the grounds of what is now called &ldquo;The Chestnuts,&rdquo;
near the west end of West Street.</p>
<h2><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
WATSON&rsquo;S FREE SCHOOL.</h2>
<p>Next in importance to the Grammar School, and prior to the
existence of the two well appointed National Schools, Church and
Wesleyan, possibly even of greater utility than at present, is
Watson&rsquo;s Free Infant School; the founder of which placed it
under the control of the Grammar School.</p>
<p>The title deeds of this Institution are in the keeping of Mr.
H. Tweed, Solicitor, who is Clerk to the Governors; and from
these we gather the following particulars of its history.&nbsp;
Richard Watson in the latter half of the 18th century was a
resident in, and a native of, Horncastle, being the son of James
Watson, who had made money by tanning, at that time a staple
business in the town.&nbsp; Although engaged in trade he ranked
with the resident gentry, his sister, Frances, marrying James
Conington, Esq., belonging to a family of good position, not only
in the town, but in the county; members of which have also
distinguished themselves at the Universities, the name still
surviving.&nbsp; She is referred to in an Indenture of date 22nd
Sept., 25 George III. (1785), as &ldquo;Frances Conington, of
Boston, widow, formerly Frances Watson, spinster, surviving
sister and heir of Richard Watson, late of Horncastle, gent.,
deceased, tanner, and his wife Elizabeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; By her
marriage she had a son Francis Conington, who as nephew of
Richard Watson, was the sole executor of his will and
testament.&nbsp; The principal deed has the following external
inscription: &ldquo;Title deeds of the school, signed, sealed and
delivered, by Benjamin Handley (afterwards called &ldquo;of New
Sleaford&rdquo;), <a name="citation108a"></a><a
href="#footnote108a" class="citation">[108a]</a> in the presence
of Williom Swallow, <a name="citation108b"></a><a
href="#footnote108b" class="citation">[108b]</a> supervisor, and
Abraham Hanson, of Horncastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>The following is the heading within, &ldquo;Sealed and
delivered by Frances Conington, being first duly stamped, in the
presence of Caleb Preston, and Bowlin Kelsey of
Boston.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is further confirmed, as follows:
&ldquo;Sealed and delivered by Frances Conington, in the presence
of William Swallow, supervisor, and Abraham Hanson, of
Horncastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follows a &ldquo;Release of lands in Lincolnshire to
found a school (dated 22nd Sept., 1785), inrolled in His
Majesty&rsquo;s High Court of Chancery, the 8th day of March, in
the year of our Lord 1786, being first duly stamped according to
the tenor of the statutes made for that purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp;

<p>The seals attached to this are those of Frances Conington,
James Conington and Benjamin Handley.&nbsp; There is a note in
the margin that &ldquo;James Conington came before me this day,
and acknowledged this to be his deed, and prayed the same might
be inrolled in His Majesty&rsquo;s High Court of Chancery.&nbsp;
Robert Chapman, Master in Chancery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dated 6th March,
1786.</p>
<p>The actual terms of Richard Watson&rsquo;s will are these:
&ldquo;I am very desirous of establishing a small school within
the town of Horncastle, wherein the children of such poor
persons, as the Governors of the Grammar School <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>shall think objects of charity, may be taught to read,
knit, spin, and plain needlework, or sewing.&nbsp; I do therefore
hereby earnestly request, will, and direct, my nephew and
executor, after my decease, by deed, conveyance (&amp;c.), to
convey, and assure, to the said Governors, and their successors,
for ever, all the lands situate in Croft, and all those
messuages, cottages, or tenements, within the yards and pingle
adjoining, situate in Far Street (now called West Street),
Horncastle; and also that part of now inclosed arable, meadow,
and pasture ground, lying in Wigtoft, containing 6 acres, 28
perches, now in the occupation of my cousin, William Watson, with
appurtenances, upon the Trusts following, viz.: (1) to keep the
house (school) in good repair, and the residence (2) for the
maintenance of a proper master or mistress, to be from time to
time nominated by them, to teach such poor children,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is then added that &ldquo;the said Richard Watson dying on
Sept. 30 (1784), the said Frances and James Conington, desirous
to fulfil his bequest, agree to convey to the use of the said
Governors, the said messuages, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; An Indenture
is added, witnessing &ldquo;that on payment by Benjamin Handley
of ten shillings to Frances and James Conington, they have
granted, sold, and released&rdquo; the aforesaid property, and
&ldquo;appointed by these presents from the day next before the
date of the Indenture, all the said messuages, &amp;c., called by
the name of the &lsquo;ffoal thing,&rsquo; <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a> and that plot commonly called
&lsquo;Backside,&rsquo; the closes in Croft abutting on the
highway, and lands near the old sea bank; and land called the
&lsquo;bridge plot&rsquo; in Wigtoft (6 acres), assigned to
Richard Watson, by the award of the Commissioners appointed by
Parliament, in the 12th year of His Majesty, for enclosing common
and open fields (No. 40 in award map), with houses, barns,
curtilages, and woods, to be held by the Governors of the Grammar
School, the reversions, rents, &amp;c., to the use of John
Thorold (and the Governors), <a name="citation110b"></a><a
href="#footnote110b" class="citation">[110b]</a> on trust, that
the said Governors collect the rents, &amp;c., and apply them as
shall be required, from time to time, for poor children; and
shall have power to erect a new school house, or alter, enlarge,
&amp;c., and to mortgage, &amp;c., in order to provide suitable
(premises), spinning wheels, &amp;c., and to make rules for
management, as shall to their judgment seem needed, agreeing with
the said Benjamin Handley, and his heirs, &amp;c., subject in all
things to the Court of Chancery at Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present status of the school is as follows: The original
premises are still in use, standing in a retired position, in
&ldquo;Watson&rsquo;s Yard,&rdquo; about 50 yards from West
Street; they consist of school buildings, play yard, and
teacher&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; In 1835 the school was enlarged
and repaired.&nbsp; In 1895 it was further improved by the
removal of bedrooms above, when it was opened up to the roof; at
the same time a commodious classroom was added at the east
end.&nbsp; Accommodation was thus provided for 120
children.&nbsp; The increase in scholars necessitated an increase
in the teaching staff, and the Head Teacher, Mrs. Robert
Marshall, who was appointed in 1885, has, since these
alterations, been assisted by an Under Mistress and two
Monitors.</p>
<p>The scholars are of both sexes, and between the ages of three
years and seven.&nbsp; The school is conducted on Church of
England principles, and <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>examined by
both Diocesan and Government Inspectors; a Government Grant being
earned to supplement the funds of the Watson bequest.&nbsp; The
scholars are taught reading, writing and arithmetic, with the
various kindergarten subjects.&nbsp; The Secretary to the
Charity, H. Tweed, Esq., Solicitor, of Horncastle, pays half the
rents to the Lincoln County Council, for teachers&rsquo;
salaries, and retains the other half for repairs and incidental
expenses.&nbsp; All the other tenements in Watson&rsquo;s Yard
are the property of the Charity.</p>
<h3>THE LANCASTERIAN &amp; THE BELL SCHOOLS.</h3>
<p>Beside the endowed schools, already described, the Grammar
School for the middle and upper class, and Watson&rsquo;s School
for the children of the poorer classes; there were two other
schools before the present National Schools came into existence,
the history of which is of some interest.&nbsp; Weir, in his
<i>History of Horncastle</i>, says &ldquo;a school, on the
Lancasterian, or British system, was established at a public
meeting, held in October, 1813; and, a few days later, a meeting
was held at the church, when it was resolved to establish a
school on the plan of Dr. Bell.&nbsp; Both buildings were erected
in 1814, supported by voluntary contributions, each for about 200
children.&rdquo; <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a></p>
<p>This needs some explanation.&nbsp; Dr. Andrew Bell was an East
Indian Company&rsquo;s Chaplain, stationed at Fort St. George,
Madras, in 1789.&nbsp; He noticed, in the course of his duties,
that in the native schools, beside the regular paid teachers, the
more advanced pupils were also employed to instruct younger
scholars; each pupil thus having a tutor, and each tutor a pupil;
a system by which both were enabled to learn faster, and led to
take more interest in their work, than would otherwise have been
generally possible.&nbsp; Being an enthusiast in educational
matters, he resigned his chaplaincy, with its good stipend, to
inaugurate, and himself carry on, a school for the children of
Europeans in the Presidency, on the same principles.&nbsp; The
result was so satisfactory that on his return to England, in
1797, he published an account of what he called the
&ldquo;Madras, or Monitorial System,&rdquo; and endeavoured to
introduce it in this country.&nbsp; Little progress, however, was
made for some time, beyond the establishment of a charity school,
on these lines, at St. Botolph&rsquo;s, Aldgate, London, and a
school at Kendal, Co. Cumberland.</p>
<p>About the same date Joseph Lancaster, a young Quaker, set up a
school for poor children, before he was 19 years of age, in a
room lent to him by his father, in the Borough Road, Southwark,
and in a very short time he had nearly 100 under his
charge.&nbsp; He also adopted the monitorial method, but, as a
Quaker, omitting the Church teaching of the Bell schools.&nbsp;
Persevering in the work, he was received in audience by the King,
George III., who gave him encouragement.&nbsp; He then travelled
over the kingdom, giving lectures on the new mode of instruction;
which in consequence spread with rapidity.&nbsp; In 1798 he
taught about 1,000 boys, between the ages of 5 and 12 years, his
sisters teaching some 200 girls.</p>
<p>Objections were made to the indefinite character of the
religious teaching of a Quaker, by Professor Marsh, and others,
and the Bell schools, with their Church instruction, had by the
year 1818 become numerous.&nbsp; The services of Dr. Bell
himself, in the cause of education had been recognised, and
rewarded by a Canonry of Westminster.&nbsp; By the year 1828
upwards of 200,000 children <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>were being
taught on his system, and at his death, a few years later, he
bequeathed &pound;120,000 to carry on the work which he had so
much at heart. <a name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a></p>
<p>These two systems, the Lancasterian or unsectarian schools,
and the Bell or church schools, continued to increase in number;
there having been established in 1805 &ldquo;The Royal
Lancasterian Institution,&rdquo; otherwise called &ldquo;The
British and Foreign School Society,&rdquo; while the Bell system
was represented by &ldquo;The Church of England National School
Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first Lancasterian or British School founded in
Horncastle, in 1814, was located in premises adjoining the Wong,
on the site afterwards occupied by the first Volunteer Drill
Hall.&nbsp; It was afterwards transferred to what is now called
Dog-Kennel Yard, occupying a building which had previously been a
theatre, and which was partly fitted up with sittings removed
from St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, giving accommodation for 200
children.&nbsp; Neither in its internal structure, however, nor
in its situation in an out-of-the-way back yard, was the former
theatre well adapted for school purposes; and although the late
Mr. Samuel Goe had in 1869 bequeathed a legacy to the school,
which rendered it almost independent of annual subscriptions, the
establishment of a much more commodious school by the Wesleyans,
in Foundry Street in 1860, affected it unfavourably, the number
of scholars gradually decreased, and it was finally closed in
1876. <a name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a></p>
<p>The Bell, or Church School, also built in 1814, and
accommodating about 200 scholars of both sexes, formed the
nucleus of the present Church National Schools.&nbsp; These two
schools, the Lancasterian or British, and the Bell or Church
School, are the only public elementary schools, named in the
<i>Gazetteers</i> for many years, except the Watson Charity
School, already described.</p>
<p>Of the present Church National Schools, that for infants was
erected in 1860, that for boys in 1872, at a cost of about
&pound;1,000, the original building being now the girls&rsquo;
school; the whole affording accommodation for 300 children.&nbsp;
These were, a few years ago, taken over by the Lindsey County
Council (in 1893), and are now under both Diocesan and Government
Inspection. <a name="citation112c"></a><a href="#footnote112c"
class="citation">[112c]</a></p>
<h3>THE SCIENCE &amp; ART SCHOOL.</h3>
<p>With the establishment of Technical Schools this country may
be said to have entered on a new era, in national education,
which, in its development, may lead to results, the importance of
which can hardly yet be realized.&nbsp; The possibilities are
almost unlimited.&nbsp; A wide-spread network has been created,
which may bring even the humblest members of our artisan families
within its deneficial meshes, while also working at intervals, as
opportunities offer, in our remotest villages.</p>
<p>This great movement, curiously, originated from dissension in
Parliament, a remarkable illustration of the old adage,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an ill wind that blows no one any
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the year 1890 the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, in Lord <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Salisbury&rsquo;s ministry, <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a> introduced what was called &ldquo;The
Local Taxation (customs and excise) Bill,&rdquo; <a
name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b"
class="citation">[113b]</a> intended to empower County Councils
to buy up the licences of superfluous public houses, and to
compensate the publicans by grants of money.&nbsp; The funds for
this purpose were not to be a charge upon the local rates, but to
be provided by an increase of the duty on spirituous
liquors.&nbsp; Strange to say, this measure was so persistently
opposed by the temperance party, aided by others, who for the
moment acted with them, that the proposed use of the money, thus
raised, was at length abandoned, a considerable surplus, however,
being thus at the Chancellor&rsquo;s disposal, after the
reduction of several other taxes, the remainder was handed over
to the County Councils, to be employed in the furtherance of
technical education.&nbsp; The money thus set apart was called
&ldquo;the ear-marked money,&rdquo; and the measure enacting it
was, somewhat unworthily, termed &ldquo;The Whiskey
Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Horncastle benefitted by a sum being placed to
the credit of the local authorities for the establishment of a
school of science and art; all such institutions in the county
being under the general direction of the organizing secretary,
Mr. S. Maudson Grant, residing in Lincoln.</p>

114</span>At first classes were held in the Masonic Hall, Bank
Street; and in 1891 an efficient teacher, Mr. Mallet, was engaged
to give commercial instruction in arithmetic, shorthand, &amp;c.,
<a name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a> and he was very successful in getting
pupils.&nbsp; In 1892 larger accommodation was required, and two
rooms were rented, over what is now the Bicycle Depot of Mr.
Sorfleet, at 14, East Street; and Mr. Switzer was engaged as
teacher of science and art, at a salary of &pound;100 a year,
being allowed further to augment his income by taking private
pupils in certain other subjects.&nbsp; About the same time
&pound;100 was spent on models, and other requisites; and by the
close of 1892, Tetford, Wragby, and Woodhall Spa having been
included in a general scheme for the district, it was found that
the pupils attending the classes already numbered 219; of whom 76
were under Mr. Mallet&rsquo;s instruction, 101 under Mr. Switzer,
including 39 school teachers in the neighbourhood, attending on
Saturdays; while 42 received special instruction from a qualified
teacher in dressmaking.&nbsp; Operations were also, in the same
year, extended to rural parishes, a meeting being held at
Woodhall Spa, on Feb. 10, presided over by the Rev. T. Livesey,
County Councillor, when a district embracing 20 parishes was
formed; Mr. Livesey being <i>ex officio</i> Chairman of
Committees, Canon J. Clare Hudson, Vicar of Thornton, appointed
as acting Chairman, and the Rev. J. Conway Walter, Rector of
Langton, Hon. Secretary.</p>
<p>This was followed by other meetings at Horncastle, at which,
in due course, plans were matured for both town and country
classes in various subjects.&nbsp; On the death of Mr. T.
Livesey, in 1894, Mr. Robert Searby, of Edlington, succeeded him
as County Councillor, and took a great interest in the school;
the late Mr. W. Brown, of the Capital and Counties Bank, was
elected Chairman, and for several years he rendered most valuable
service to the schools, being followed, on his decease in 1901,
by Mr. R. W. Clitherow, Solicitor, who had previously acted as
Treasurer.&nbsp; So far the whole scheme had been attended by the
most marked success in all departments.</p>
<p>In the year 1894 the numbers of pupils, and of the subjects
taught, had further increased; and it became necessary again to
move into more commodious premises.&nbsp; The large building in
Queen Street, which had been erected by the late Mr. F. Stevens,
of Gordon Villa, and was then occupied by Miss Morris, as a
school for young ladies, was rented, having two large classrooms
and a smaller one.</p>
<p>Among the teachers who followed was Miss Annie Foster, who
succeeded Mr. Switzer in July, 1895, and continued as head of the
Institution for nearly six years.&nbsp; She was a most
enthusiastic and energetic worker, and under her the schools
attained the highest point of success, both as regards the number
of pupils attending and the variety of subjects taught.&nbsp; The
school at this time had attained to the highest degree of
efficiency which it is ever likely to reach.&nbsp; Not only had
Horncastle pupils taken more prizes than those of any other
technical school in the Parts of Lindsey, but on the visit of the
Government Inspector, Mr. Minton, at the prize-giving in
September, 1896, he stated that the school occupied the third
place in all England. <a name="citation114b"></a><a
href="#footnote114b" class="citation">[114b]</a></p>
<p>In the year 1899 again the Inspector, on his examination in
October, reported its state as being &ldquo;very
satisfactory,&rdquo; and in that year grants were earned of
&pound;140 from the County Council, &pound;35 from South
Kensington Science <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>and Art department, &pound;50 from
the Whitehall department, &pound;12 from fees for science and art
teaching, &pound;10 from the evening continuation classes, a
total of &pound;247.&nbsp; Miss Foster was assisted by Miss M. E.
Edgar.&nbsp; A former pupil, Mr. C. H. Stevens, a native of
Horncastle, was also appointed Assistant Master, until he was
promoted to take charge of a technical school at
Folkestone.&nbsp; Mr. A. Blades, of the London University, Junior
Master of the Grammar School, was for a time an Assistant.&nbsp;
At the end of 1900 (Nov. 15) Miss Foster resigned, being promoted
to the head teachership of the Camden School of Art, in
London.&nbsp; Miss M. E. Edgar, who had been assistant teacher
for several years, was at this date appointed Head Teacher, in
the Science and Art department, Mr. C. W. Gott, of the Grammar
School, B.A. of London University, becoming Head Master of the
evening continuation school, and Mr. H. J. Haddock teacher of
shorthand.</p>
<p>It would not be possible, nor is it desirable, here to go into
full details as to all the work done; but as, in future years, it
may be interesting to have some record of the progress in the
earlier days of this Institution, and as the writer of these
pages has been closely connected with the school, from its first
inception, a summary of the more important particulars is here
given.</p>
<p>In the spring of the year 1896, a course of public lectures,
illustrated by lantern views, was given by himself, descriptive
of his own travels in Egypt, which were attended by full
audiences of junior pupils, and many adults.&nbsp; In 1897 he
gave a similar series of lectures on his travels in Palestine,
and these proving equally popular, a third supplementary course
was given by him in 1898.</p>
<p>In 1898 illustrated lectures were also given by the Rev. J. A.
Penny, Vicar of Wispington, on &ldquo;The Abbeys and Castles of
England,&rdquo; and as being very instructive on the subject of
architecture, these were largely attended.&nbsp; They were
followed by a course, which proved very interesting, given by Mr.
R. W. Clitherow, the Treasurer, descriptive of a walking tour
made by himself, among the scenery of the English lakes.&nbsp; He
also gave an instructive lecture on Canada.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1898 the Head Teacher, Miss Foster, gave a
series of lectures on &ldquo;Physiography,&rdquo; being an
account, the result of most careful study and practical
investigation, of the various geological formations and fossils
of the earth, illustrated by specimens largely of her own
collecting. <a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a>&nbsp; These were very instructive, and
attended by a fairly numerous class of pupils.</p>
<p>Other valuable courses of lectures were given during this
early period of the school&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; In the autumn
of 1896 Dr. R. McLay, of Horncastle, was engaged by the Committee
to give lectures in the Masonic Hall, on &ldquo;First Aid to the
Injured,&rdquo; under the St. John&rsquo;s Ambulance
regulations.&nbsp; The pupils, numbering 25, were afterwards
examined by Dr. G. M. Lowe, of Lincoln, when 23 of them passed as
entitled to St. John&rsquo;s Ambulance Certificates.&nbsp; So
much interest was shewn in these lectures (to which policemen
were specially invited), that it was resolved, in the following
year (1897), that the services of Dr. McLay should be secured for
a repetition of them, with increased remuneration.&nbsp; They
were again given in the autumn of that year (beginning Oct. 18),
when 24 persons attended, of whom 16 presented themselves for
examination, which was again held by Dr. Lowe, all of whom passed
with credit, and gained <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>ambulance
certificates.&nbsp; We give these particulars as shewing the
value of the work done at this period.</p>
<p>Similarly valuable instruction has been given in later years,
but, with diminished funds available, and classes smaller, owing
doubtless to the exhaustion in some degree of the stream of
candidates for instruction, compared with its flush at the outset
of the school&rsquo;s existence, fewer lectures on these extra
subjects have been given; and instruction has been confined to
more ordinary, but not less useful, work, in drawing, geometric
and from models; modelling in clay, painting in water colours and
oils, book-keeping, arithmetic, shorthand, French, and so
forth.</p>
<p>To show that the school has continued to do good work, we may
state that on January 25, 1906, a meeting was held for the annual
prize giving, when close upon 70 pupils, of both sexes (69),
received rewards, several of them for success in four or five
different subjects.&nbsp; For the year 1905&ndash;6 the school
received a grant of &pound;100 from the County Council, &pound;25
from the Horncastle Urban Council, and the fees of pupils paid
about half the expenses.</p>
<p>We now give a brief account of the more important of the work
carried on during the same period in the country parishes.&nbsp;
In March, 1892, the first &ldquo;pioneer&rdquo; lecture was given
at Woodhall Spa, on Horticulture, by Mr. Horace Huntly, lately in
charge of the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s gardens at Woburn Abbey,
Beds.&nbsp; This was well attended, and the instruction given was
most useful, for the better cultivation of cottagers&rsquo;
gardens.&nbsp; This was followed by a course of three lectures on
the same subject, in March of the succeeding year.&nbsp; In April
of the same year (1892), a series of six lectures were given at
Stixwould and Horsington, by Miss Kenealy, of the National Health
Society, on the subject of home nursing, and treatment in cases
of accident, fevers, &amp;c.&nbsp; These also proved so
instructive that she was engaged to repeat them in the summer of
the following year; and they were given in eight different
parishes, beginning with Langton on June 5th; the attendances
being very large, in one case 70 being present.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Jalland, Surgeon, of Horncastle, also gave a
lecture at Kirkby-on-Bain, in April of the same year, on the
subject: &ldquo;How to secure healthy homes,&rdquo; which was
very instructive and well attended, over 40 being present.&nbsp;
In the autumn of that year a series of five lectures on Cookery
were given by Mrs. Pierce, of the National Health Society, at
four centres, Roughton, Thimbleby, Horsington, and Minting,
beginning on Oct. 10th, and continued weekly.&nbsp; These were
considered so instructive that the Secretary, having made notes
of them, was requested to have 500 copies printed, for free
distribution, which was done.</p>
<p>In January of 1893 lectures on butter-making, with practical
demonstrations, were given by Miss Carter, a professional teacher
with certificate of the B.D.F.A., in nine parishes, from Jan.
12th to 24th.&nbsp; Lessons in sheep shearing were given in May,
at eight centres, Roughton, Kirkstead, Woodhall, Langton,
Wispington, Stixwould, Bucknall, and Thimbleby, the teachers
being Mr. S. Leggett of Moorhouses, Boston, and Mr. R. Sharpe of
Horsington; prizes of &pound;1 and 10/- being given to the most
proficient pupils.</p>
<p>In 1894 lessons were given in hedge plashing, on Mr.
Gaunt&rsquo;s farm at Waddingworth, in November, the teacher
being Mr. H. Butler of Greetham, money prizes being given.&nbsp;
Lessons in under-draining were given on Mr. Carter&rsquo;s farm
at Bucknall, in December, the teacher being Mr. W. Scott of
Hatton, money prizes being also given.</p>
<p>In 1895 lectures on poultry keeping were given in February, by
Mr. E. <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Brown, F.L.S., and Mr. F. Parton, at
five centres; and they also visited various farmyards in the
neighbourhood to give practical advice; these lessons were well
attended.&nbsp; Lessons in horse shoeing were given at
Horncastle, for the neighbourhood, by Mr. J. B Gresswell,
M.R.V.C., of Louth, in May and June, at which nine blacksmiths
attended; certificates of the National Association of Farriers
being awarded.&nbsp; Lessons on sheep shearing were given at
Thimbleby, Kirkstead, and Bucknall, in June, the teacher being
Mr. R. Sharpe of Horsington.&nbsp; Dairy lessons on butter making
and stilton cheese production were given by Miss Carter, at
Woodhall Spa, Kirkby-on-Bain, Minting, and Reed&rsquo;s Beck, in
October and November.&nbsp; Lessons in under-draining were given
on Mr. F. W. Scott&rsquo;s farm, at Bucknall, in December, the
teacher being Mr. W. Scott of Hatton, and money prizes
given.&nbsp; Two lectures on bee keeping were given at Woodhall
Spa, in November, 1895, by Mr. W. J. Banks of the Grammar School,
Wragby, which were well attended; the same gentleman also giving
a practical demonstration of the same, by request, at the Manor
House, Woodhall Spa, in August of the following year (1896).</p>

</a></p>
<p>In 1896 Hedge Plashing lessons were given, in January, at
Stixwould, Bucknall, and Horsington, the teacher being Mr. W.
Scott of Hatton.&nbsp; The Head Secretary, Mr. S. Maudson Grant,
was present and said he was &ldquo;much <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>pleased
with the work done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lessons in stack thatching were
given, in September, in the yards of Mr. H. N. Coates, of
Langton, Mr. R. Roberts, of Thimbleby, and Mr. S. Harrison, of
Roughton, to ten candidates, the teacher being Mr. Isaac Storey,
of West Ashby.&nbsp; These extended over four days, and were
pronounced by the General Secretary, Mr. S. Maudson Grant, of
Lincoln, to be &ldquo;highly satisfactory.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
November lessons in under-draining were again given by Mr. W.
Scott, of Hatton, on the farm of Mr. Joseph Clifton, of
Horsington, to two classes of candidates, those over and those
under 24 years of age, and were well attended.</p>
<p>In 1897 hedge plashing lessons were given in February, on the
farm of Mr. S. Harrison, of Roughton, also by Mr. W. Scott, on
three days, to two classes, over and under 24 years of age, being
also well attended; prizes of 25/-, 20/-, and 15/- being given to
each class; and two extra prizes of 7/6.</p>
<p>Poultry lectures were given, also in February, extending over
six days, at Mr. Bates Leedale&rsquo;s farm, at Woodhall, and at
Mr. W. H. Holmes&rsquo;, of Minting House, by Mr. W. Cook, the
well-known chicken breeder, and originator of the breed named
&ldquo;Orpingtons,&rdquo; of Orpington House, St. Mary Cray, Kent
(since deceased).&nbsp; These lectures created the greatest
interest; the audiences were crowded, at one lecture there being
127 present; and as he visited many farmyards to give advice, and
several farmers bought valuable chickens from him, his visit may
be said to have materially improved the breed of fowls in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In May of this year, 1897, it was decided at head-quarters to
make a change in the process of operations.&nbsp; Hitherto
instruction in the country parishes had been provided through the
Committee of the Science and Art School, at Horncastle, but from
this date each parish was to have its own Technical Education
Committee, elected annually, with the other parish officials; and
these were to apply direct to the Head Secretary, at Lincoln, for
such instruction as they might think desirable, parishes uniting
for this purpose if they chose to do so.&nbsp; More money than
heretofore was now being expended on the Science and Art School
in Lincoln, and the grants for the country lessons were now
greatly reduced.&nbsp; Of this country instruction no record was
henceforth kept at Horncastle, and no detailed account can
therefore be given here; the lessons have been mainly confined to
hedge plashing, ploughing, under-draining, and such other
practical subjects as suited the farmer, or agricultural
labourer.</p>
<p>In conclusion it may be said that although it is yet too early
to prophecy, it would seem that a great future lies before us in
the development of education.&nbsp; Co-ordination of work between
(as we have at Horncastle) the endowed Infant School, the
National Schools, Technical Schools, and the
&ldquo;secondary&rdquo; Grammar School, with higher-grade
colleges, should furnish a kind of educational ladder, by which
the child of the artizan, or rustic, may rise from the humblest
position to the highest, if he has the ability, and the will, to
avail himself of the opportunities thus placed within his
reach.&nbsp; It is hardly too much to say that the result may
well be, that in the keen rivalry of nations, which characterizes
the present age, England should thus be enabled to more than hold
her own in the struggle of industrial life.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 119</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
THE DISPENSARY</h2>
<p>May well be said to be the most important charity in the town,
not only from the valuable services which it has, through many
years, rendered to the suffering poor, but because it was a
pioneer institution of its kind; while the area of its usefulness
has probably been more extensive than that of any similar charity
in the county.</p>
<p>Dispensaries were established at Louth in the year 1803, at
Lincoln in 1826, at Grantham in 1838, at Boston in 1852, at
Market Rasen in 1857; but Horncastle was in advance of the
earliest of these by more than a dozen years.&nbsp; Further, the
records of the charity shew, that, in the early years of its
existence, patients were here treated from places so distant as
Spilsby, Friskney, Wainfleet, Trusthorpe, Theddlethorpe, Alford,
Fotherby, Marsh Chapel, Saltfleetby, Boston, Lincoln, Sleaford,
Grantham, and even beyond the county, from Loughborough, Hull,
and Beverley.</p>
<p>This, it may be explained, was mainly due to the fact that it
was virtually the creation of a man who was, in many matters, in
advance of his time, that great public benefactor, Sir Joseph
Banks, Bart., of Revesby Abbey, who held the Manor of Horncastle,
and took the greatest interest in the welfare of the town and
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>At a preliminary meeting held at the Bull Inn, Horncastle, on
Wednesday, Oct., 28, 1789, it was resolved, apparently on his
initiative, to establish a dispensary; and this took formal shape
on Dec. 3rd following, when the governing body was elected,
consisting of Sir Jos. Banks, President, with Vice-Presidents the
Honble. Lewis Dymoke, King&rsquo;s Champion, Thomas Coltman,
Esq., William Elmhirst, Esq., Treasurer, and Richard Clitherow,
Gent., legal adviser; the Honorary Physicians being Edmund
Laycock, M.D., and Edward Harrison, M.D., with Mr. John Chislett
as Surgeon and Apothecary.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>A code of rules was drawn up, which, with occasional
revisions, to suit changing circumstances, remain substantially
the same to the present day.&nbsp; A donation of 10 guineas
constituted a life Governor, a legacy of the like amount gave the
trustee paying it the same privilege.&nbsp; An annual
subscription of one guinea made the subscriber a Governor during
the year.&nbsp; Church or chapel collections of two guineas
secured governorship for the year to the minister, and an
additional Governor for each two guineas so collected.&nbsp; The
officials were to be a President, Vice-Presidents, and Treasurer,
elected annually at a special meeting of the Governors.&nbsp;
Other regulations, as to patients and their attendance, numbered
between 40 and 50.</p>
<p>The institution was to be open on Tuesdays and Saturdays from
11 a.m. till noon, when the medical officers would prescribe for
patients, attending with a governor&rsquo;s nomination.&nbsp;
Those unable to attend should be visited at their homes.&nbsp; As
a small practical beginning the wooden framework of a shop was
bought at Wainfleet, for the small sum of 5/5; and drugs were
ordered from the firm of Wallis &amp; Stockton, of York; and a
further supply obtained from Messrs. Skeen &amp; Peale, of
London.</p>
<p>The first building, which was used from 1789 till 1867, was
No. 2 on the south side of St. Mary&rsquo;s Churchyard, being
rented for the sum of five guineas a year, until it was purchased
in Feb., 1810, for the institution, jointly by Dr. Harrison and
the Rev. John Fretwell, <a name="citation120a"></a><a
href="#footnote120a" class="citation">[120a]</a> for &pound;111
2s. 8d., the conveyance being effected by Mr. Clitherow at a
charge of &pound;13 15s. 8d.&nbsp; Improvements were made in this
building, at a cost of &pound;13 5s., in 1812, and of &pound;27
15s. 7d. in 1821.</p>
<p>Of the first physicians, Dr. Laycock resigned office in his
first year, on Sept. 29th, 1790; but Dr. Harrison continued his
duties for many years, only retiring on Oct. 11th, 1821, shortly
before his death.&nbsp; Although that gentleman carried on a
private asylum, for patients mentally affected, at his own
residence in West Street, <a name="citation120b"></a><a
href="#footnote120b" class="citation">[120b]</a> he took a great
interest in the Dispensary, and was indefatigable in his
attendances, often at his own inconvenience.&nbsp; Moreover his
pecuniary assistance was not small; as, besides sharing in the
purchase of the premises in St. Mary&rsquo;s Churchyard, the
accounts shew that in 1820 he paid &pound;27, and in the
following year &pound;19 14s. 4d., for Dispensary expenses, which
sums were afterwards repaid to him by the Governors; and (as will
be shewn hereafter) he bequeathed at his death &pound;100 to the
funds.&nbsp; A vote of thanks was passed to him at the annual
meeting of the Governors in September of 1821, for a further gift
of &pound;21, with the expression of their regret that his
valuable services could no longer be given.&nbsp; Associated with
Dr. Harrison, in dispensary work, was Dr. Fawssett, appointed on
the resignation of Dr. Laycock, who loyally co-operated with that
gentleman for 33 years, and only survived him two years, dying on
Oct. 16th. 1823.</p>
<p>Since that time almost all the medical men of the town have,
in their <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>turns, rendered useful service to
the Dispensary.&nbsp; It would be invidious to single out any of
these as being more capable, or more devoted to the work, than
others; but we may mention one exceptional case, which all will
recognize.&nbsp; From an early period medical pupils were allowed
to visit the Dispensary, in order to study special cases, and the
treatment they received from qualified practitioners.&nbsp; Among
these was a young man, Mr. E. P. Charlesworth, who virtually here
received the early part of his medical education.&nbsp; He
afterwards, for some years, practised in Horncastle; and in Dec.,
1807, a resolution of the Governors was passed, conveying to him
their warm thanks for his generosity in relieving poor patients,
often at his own expense, and for his readiness to receive them,
for consultation, at his own residence, and to make up drugs for
them at all hours.&nbsp; He subsequently removed to Lincoln, and
became a noted physician, whose reputation extended considerably
beyond the county.&nbsp; During 33 years he was one of the most
active medical advisers and patrons of the Lincoln Lunatic
Asylum; and, after his death in 1853, a statue of him, in white
marble, was erected in the grounds of that institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>All these medical attendants at the Dispensary gave their
services gratuitously until, at a general meeting, held on April
23rd, 1878, a resolution was passed, that henceforth the two
doctors should each be paid &pound;30 a year, which has been the
rule ever since.&nbsp; At that date the late Dr A. E. Boulton
resigned, and Mr. Robert Jalland and Dr. Haddon were the first to
receive this well-merited remuneration, attending to their duties
in alternate months.</p>
<p>Scattered about the minute books of the institution are
various notes, of some interest, from which we here give a
selection.&nbsp; On Feb. 23rd, 1790, the Rev. John Fretwell,
&ldquo;sensible of the distresses of the sick poor, gave one and
a half guineas from the communion money, to be laid out in salop
sago and <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Bowen&rsquo;s sago powder, to be
distributed at the discretion of the faculty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nov.
27th, 1790, cases of small pox having occurred in the town, it
was resolved to inoculate all poor persons, free of charge; and
thereafter many names are given of those who underwent the
operation.&nbsp; With this we may compare the following entry as
indicating the progress of medical science during 12 years.&nbsp;
June 8th, 1802, an epidemic of small pox having occurred, and
&ldquo;inoculation becoming general, the Governors recommend
vaccination.&rdquo;&nbsp; A statement was printed for
circulation, that in 100,000 cases of vaccination, not one death
had ensued; that it was now practised in all parts of the world,
and favourably received, and that the National Institution of
France had pronounced it to be the greatest discovery of the last
century. <a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a></p>
<p>Feb. 4th, 1792, has an entry, in no way bearing upon
dispensary work, but interesting as a memento of an old mode of
conveyance.&nbsp; The proprietors of the sedan chair asked
permission for it to be kept at the Dispensary, for which they
were willing to pay one guinea annually; and this was agreed to
at the next meeting of the Governors.&nbsp; This chair was let
out to convey ladies to evening parties in the town.&nbsp; It was
borne by two men, and was in use within living memory, as late as
&ldquo;in the sixties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>April 21st, 1792.&nbsp; A gift of apparatus for the recovery
of drowned persons, with a drag, was received from the Royal
Humane Society of London.&nbsp; A water bed was afterwards
purchased, which was let out for a small fee to poor patients,
temporarily bed-ridden.</p>
<p>On Nov. 28th, 1809, at a special meeting of the Governors, the
usefulness of the Dispensary was further extended by the
appointment of a midwife, to attend upon poor women in labor,
both in town and country, being paid from the funds of the
charity, a fee of 3/6 for each case; and from the year 1810 to
1829, inclusive, Mrs. Elizabeth Southwell is mentioned, from time
to time, as acting in that capacity.&nbsp; In the years 1829, 30
and 31, owing to the increase in the number of patients, special
appeals were made to the landowners of the district for increased
support.</p>
<p>In July, 1834, a resolution was passed that doctors attending
patients at the Dispensary, might introduce pupils, to study
cases under their treatment; and, in one case, a lady applied for
permission to attend a course of instruction, in order that she
might be enabled to assist her husband in making up
medicines.&nbsp; From 1840 to 1894 drugs were supplied by Messrs.
Herring &amp; Co., of London, but since that they have been
supplied by local chemists, who are subscribers.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1840 there was an epidemic of scarlatina, and
of the 237 patients on the books, 50 were suffering from that
complaint.&nbsp; In consequence of the additional work thus
caused, the salary of the dispenser was raised from &pound;40 to
&pound;60 a year.</p>
<p>Again, with regard to a new source of income, among early
notices we find the following: that on Sept. 29th, 1790, the
first anniversary of the Dispensary&rsquo;s formation, a sermon
was preached, on its behalf, at a service in the parish church,
by the Rev. John Dymoke, Rector of Scrivelsby, and Chaplain to
his grace the Duke of St. Albans.&nbsp; This became an annual
observance, and has continued so ever since, the preachers being
selected with special care, and often from a considerable
distance.&nbsp; For instance, at the following anniversary, <!--
page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>in 1791, the Rev. Everard Duckworth, LL.D., Prebendary
of Canterbury, was invited to preach, and he being unable to
undertake that office, the Rev. Peter Bulmer, Vicar of Thorpe,
officiated in his stead.&nbsp; Among other preachers named we
find the Rev. Basil Beridge, well-known for his works of charity,
Rector of Algarkirk, near Boston; the Rev. W. Goodenough,
Archdeacon of Carlisle; the Rev. E. R. Mantell, Vicar of Louth,
and other prominent clergy of the county.</p>
<p>How widely the institution was appreciated is shewn by the
number of leading persons who gave it their patronage.&nbsp; Sir
Joseph Banks was its warmest supporter, through life, regularly
attending the committee meetings, either as a Governor or
President, until his decease, June 19, 1820; and his example
brought to the meetings members of the Chaplin, Massingberd, and
Heneage families, Lord Yarborough, and others, at no small
inconvenience, from considerable distances.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Among other Presidents have been the widowed Lady Banks; Lord
Yarborough, on several occasions; the Honble. and Rev. John
Dymoke; to whom succeeded the Honble. Henry, afterwards Sir Henry
Dymoke, Bart.; Lord Worsley; the Right Honble. E. Stanhope, M.P.;
J. Banks Stanhope, Esq.&nbsp; After the death of Mr. Stanhope,
Jan. 18th, 1904, it was resolved, at a special meeting of the
Governors, Jan. 28th, that the Secretary should record, among the
minutes, their regret at his death, and their high appreciation
of his <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>long and generous support.&nbsp; The
chairman was requested to send a copy of this to the Honble. Mrs.
Stanhope; and at a meeting held on March 31st, following, a very
kind letter in reply was read from Mrs. Stanhope, promising her
support in the future, in lieu of that of the deceased
gentleman.&nbsp; The chairman was again requested to convey to
her the thanks of the Governors, and Mrs. Stanhope was elected
and continued to be President until her death, October 25th,
1907.</p>
<p>Among Vice-Presidents have been two Earls Fortescue (father
and son); Lord Worsley: Sir Joseph Hawley, Bart.; J. Hassard
Short, Esq.; Earl Manvers; C. H. Massingberd Mundy, Esq.; General
Sir E. Brackenbury, Knight of Hanover; J. Lewis Ffytche, Esq.;
Capt. Dallas York, Lord Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby; Sir H. M.
Hawley, Bart.</p>
<p>For many years a ball was given in aid of the funds, in the
Assembly Room, Bull Hotel, Horncastle, which (with the exception
perhaps of the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; ball at Lincoln) was the most
fashionably attended of any such gathering in the county.&nbsp;
Among the stewards of this ball we find the names of G. M.
Alington, Esq., of Swinhope Hall; Joseph Livesey, Esq., Stourton
Hall; C. Waldo Sibthorpe, Esq., Canwick Hall; G. F. W. Sibthorpe,
Esq.; Col. Sibthorpe, M.P.; the Right Honble. C. T.
d&rsquo;Egremont, M.P.; E. Heneage, Esq., M.P.; Capt. Mansell, of
Well Hall; G. B. Langton, Esq., of Langton Hall; J. Banks
Stanhope, M.P.; Sir Montague Cholmondly, Bart.; Sir Charles H. J.
Anderson, of Lea, Bart.; Sir William Ingilby, Bart., Ripley
Castle, Yorks; Lord Yarborough; H. Handley, M.P., Sleaford; Lord
Amelius Beauclerk; Capt. Boucherett, North Willingham Hall;
Honble. Capt. Monson; Capt. Lionel Dymoke.</p>
<p>Among the lady patronesses were Lady Worsley, the Duchess of
St. Albans, Lady Mary Christopher, Mrs. G. W. Sibthorpe, Lady
Anderson, Mrs. Livesey, Lady Nelthorpe, Lady Dymoke, Lady Albinia
Pye.</p>
<p>These balls were discontinued, to the general regret, and to
the loss of the dispensary, after the year 1871; and to make up
for the loss Mr. J. Banks Stanhope in that year presented the
institution with a cheque for &pound;20.</p>
<p>We close this list of officials, with a brief account of the
dispensers, on whom the efficiency of the institution largely
depended.&nbsp; They were usually qualified chemists, or surgeons
and apothecaries; and generally also acted as secretaries.&nbsp;
The first of these we have already named, Mr. John Chislett, to
him succeeded Mr. Lewis Bilton, secretary and compositor,
1793&ndash;1799; L. Barton, compositor, 1799&ndash;1801; G. Lunn,
compositor, 1801&ndash;1807; John Lenton, compositor,
1807&ndash;1809; William Morley, compositor, 1809&ndash;1810;
Thomas Taylor, surgeon apothecary, compositor, 1811&ndash;1826;
Thomas Snaith, Surgeon, 1826&ndash;1834; William Ward, surgeon
and apothecary, 1834&ndash;1839; W. Shepherd, 1839&ndash;1840 (ad
interim); Francis Macarthur, <a name="citation124"></a><a
href="#footnote124" class="citation">[124]</a> dispenser,
1840&ndash;1865; William Caunt, dispenser, 1865&ndash;75; William
Betts, Chemist and Druggist, 1875, Lady-day; elected secretary
Nov. 2nd, 1882; his services have extended over a longer period
than those of any previous dispenser.</p>
<p>On the death of the Champion, Sir Henry Dymoke, Bart., April
28th, 1865, the Governors resolved to erect a new dispensary, as
a memorial of his long connection with the charity.&nbsp;
Circulars were issued inviting subscriptions, and, among other
donors, Robert Vyner, Esq., of Gautby Hall, gave &pound;200; <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>the site of 52, North Street, was purchased, and the
present building was erected in 1866.&nbsp; In 1867 the old house
in the churchyard was sold for &pound;142 11s. 4d., and the new
premises were occupied in the autumn of that year.&nbsp; It was
built from the designs of Messrs. Bellamy &amp; Hardy,
Architects, of Lincoln, the contractor for the work being Mr.
Robert Carter, Builder, of North Street, Horncastle.&nbsp; The
original contract was for &pound;765, but the ultimate cost, with
furniture, lawyer&rsquo;s expenses, &amp;c., amounted to
&pound;1,026 10s. 11d.&nbsp; It is subject to a ground rent of
&pound;1 to the Stanhope estate.</p>
<p>Of late years the support, by subscriptions, has on several
occasions been inadequate.&nbsp; In January, 1899, there being a
deficit of &pound;70, the late Mr. J. Banks Stanhope gave the
Governors a cheque for that amount.&nbsp; In the year 1905, there
being again a serious deficit, application was made to the
trustees of the Hurstcroft and Snowden charity, and they
contributed &pound;20 on condition that 25 poor children should
receive medical treatment free of charge.&nbsp; A further sum of
&pound;53 14s. remaining as a surplus, in the hands of the Soup
Kitchen Committee, was also given to the funds.&nbsp; Canon
Quarrington, formerly Vicar of Horncastle, also contributed
&pound;20; and other donations made up a relief fund of
&pound;106 (see Report for the year).&nbsp; The debt was thus
wiped out, but death having carried off many former subscribers,
increased support will be needed in the future.</p>
<p>Legacies have been bequeathed to the institution by various
persons, at different times, as follows: Dr. Harrison, by will
dated Feb. 5th, 1820, left &pound;100; the late H. J. Fielding,
Esq., who died Aug. 10th, 1879, left by will &pound;100; in 1884
the late Mr. T. Garfit bequeathed &pound;100; ten &pound;10
shares in the railway were bequeathed by Mrs. Fox Marshall in
1897; &pound;100 was bequeathed by Mr. J. W. Hart, of Tetford, in
1900; Mr. John Bancroft left &pound;50 in 1905; &pound;357 were
invested in Consols and &pound;200 in railway shares, in 1899; a
portion of this was sold in 1902, and &pound;300 were invested in
the Corn Exchange; the Dispensary premises were also insured for
&pound;800, instead of &pound;600, in the County Fire Office, in
1902.</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that although the operations of the
institution no longer embrace the extended area of the early
years of its existence, it is still doing a most valuable work in
the alleviation of suffering among the poor and needy, in both
town and country for many miles round, and is thoroughly
deserving of the increased support, which is required, to
continue its efficiency.&nbsp; We trust that this will be
recognized by the land owners and others, and that such
assistance will be forthcoming.</p>

THE CANAL.</h2>
<p>The Horncastle Canal, connecting for commerce the town with
the river Witham, and so with Lincoln, Boston, and the sea,
though now a derelict, was formerly of much value.&nbsp; Its
history is here given from its earliest inception.</p>
<p>Horncastle having been for some centuries the chief market of
an important agricultural district, an association was formed
towards the close of the 18th century, with the title &ldquo;The
Company of Proprietors of Horncastle Navigation, in the County of
Lincoln.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, in the year 1792, incorporated by
an Act of Parliament, which gave a list of the names of the
original members, and secured to them, and to their successors,
perpetual possession of the same, and a common seal.&nbsp; The
canal was to be 11 miles long, extending from the junction of the
two rivers, Bain and Waring, which traverse the town and meet at
the point where now stands the public swimming bath, to the
Witham at Tattershall; and passing through the parishes of
Thornton, Martin, Dalderby, Roughton, Haltham, Kirkby, Coningsby,
and Tattershall.</p>
<p>The company had at first a capital of &pound;15,000 in
&pound;50 shares, no member being allowed to hold less than one
share or more than 20.&nbsp; The surveyors for the undertaking
were Messrs. Robert Stickney and Samuel Dickinson.</p>
<p>When about two-thirds of the work was completed this capital
was exhausted; and in the year 1800 a second Act of Parliament
was obtained, which authorised the raising of a supplementary sum
of &pound;20,000 in shares of &pound;50; additional members being
enrolled, and mortgages raised on the tolls.&nbsp; The whole
profits of the concern, for several years, were absorbed in
paying off the debt thus contracted, so that no dividend accrued
for the shareholders until the year 1813.&nbsp; The channel, from
Horncastle to Dalderby, was an entirely new cut, the rest being
the river Bain deepened and straightened in its course.&nbsp; It
was adapted for the passage of vessels of 50 tons burden; and in
the whole length of 11 miles there was a fall of 84 feet.</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>The original rate of charges was 2/- per ton for the
whole length of the canal, 1/9 to the seventh lock, and 1/3 to
the fourth lock; vessels laden with lime, manure, or material for
roads, were granted free passage. <a name="citation127"></a><a
href="#footnote127" class="citation">[127]</a>&nbsp; By the
second Act of Parliament, in 1800, the charges were raised to 3/3
per ton for the whole length of the canal, 2/7 to the seventh
lock, and 1/6 to the fourth lock; lime, manure, and road material
being exempted, as before.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p127b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Canal"
title=
"The Canal"
src="images/p127s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The whole structure was completed in the autumn of 1802, and
the canal was formally opened on Friday, Sept. 17th of that
year.&nbsp; The occasion was observed as a general holiday by the
towns-folk.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock the boats the Betsy of
Horncastle, and the Martha of Dalderby, the property of Messrs.
Gilliat &amp; Wilson, and the British Queen, owned by Mr. Boyers,
were hauled into the two basins of the canal, elaborately
decorated with colours, amid the cheers of spectators, who are
said to have numbered more than 2,000.&nbsp; The vessels having
been brought to, several salutes were fired, and a band of music,
on the pleasure boat of Mr. Lane, played &ldquo;God save the
King,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hearts of
Oak,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Having traversed some distance on the
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>canal the company afterwards landed at the wharfs on
the two branches, and a large number of the shareholders partook
of a festive repast at the Greyhound Inn, East Street, near the
south basin.&nbsp; The navvies and other workmen who had been
employed in the construction of the canal, were also regaled on
the boats, and afterwards feasted at the Greyhound.</p>
<p>In following years an excursion was made annually by the
Directors, conveyed down the canal, in a fine barge, which was
their own property, named &ldquo;The Lady Banks,&rdquo; in order
to inspect its condition; and this was followed by a public
dinner at the Bull Hotel, which continued to be an established
institution during the period of the canal&rsquo;s
prosperity.</p>
<p>The shares quickly rose considerably in value; a great number
of barges came to the town, and it was no uncommon occurrence to
see the whole distance from the South bridge to the Bow bridge
packed closely with heavily laden vessels, carrying coals, grain,
or other merchandise.&nbsp; In 1836 it was computed that about
30,000 quarters of wheat, and 3,000 packs of wool, passed through
the canal annually; and in 1850 the profits of the traffic
amounted to about &pound;2,000 a year.</p>
<p>Consequent on the opening of the railway in August, 1855, the
canal, as a means of goods conveyance, gradually became disused,
until, of late years, it has become worse than a mere derelict,
since it forms an obstruction to the free passage of the water
brought down by the two rivers, and after heavy rain it has led
to temporary inundations of the town, to the great inconvenience
of those residing near it, as well as interfering, as might in
some circumstances be serious, with the sanitary
arrangements.</p>
<p>A few years ago an attempt was made to restore the canal
traffic, but the railway monopoly had become too thoroughly
established, and the project failed; yet the competition, could
it have been maintained, might have had a salutary effect upon
the cost of railway conveyance, to the advantage of the general
public.</p>
<p>Our canals, it should be remembered, are a time-honoured
institution; the Lincolnshire Cardyke and Fossdyke date from the
period of the Roman occupation of this country.&nbsp; The Magna
Charta of the early 13th century took cognizance, not only of the
roads, called &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Highway,&rdquo; but also of
inland navigation, under the term &ldquo;Haut streames de le
Roy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter half of the 18th century was
remarkable for great achievements as regards internal waterways,
notably in the Bridgewater Canal, and the Grand Junction Canal of
London; and to this period, as we have seen, the Horncastle Canal
belongs.</p>
<p>In this twentieth century, again, notwithstanding the great
railway facilities, there is a wide-spread movement in favour of
extended water traffic, headed by the very successful Suez Canal;
with a prospect of the sister channel of Panama.&nbsp; Berlin is
said to owe its prosperity largely to its well-organized system,
connecting the rivers Oder, Elbe, Spree, &amp;c., which have an
annual traffic of some million and half tons.&nbsp; Our own
Manchester Ship Canal is another instance; the most recent case
being fresh developments of the Aire and Calder Navigation, in
South Yorkshire.&nbsp; The canals, too, which have been recently
constructed in India, are yielding, by the latest reports, <a
name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a> a handsome revenue to the Government,
as well as greatly benefiting the native population.</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>It is acknowledged that a more general use of
waterways, throughout the kingdom for the cheaper transport of
our heavier and more bulky produce, would be a national boon; and
a Royal Commission was engaged in considering the subject of the
acquisition of all canals as Government property. <a
name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a"
class="citation">[129a]</a></p>
<p>It is now being more and more recognised that, on the
establishment of railways, everyone jumped too hastily to the
conclusion that the days of canals were over; whereas, in truth,
there is still a large field, probably an increasing field, for
the cheaper traffic in heavy goods, which canals can provide
for.&nbsp; The Belgian town of Bruges, though situated several
miles inland, is now to be converted into a port by the
government of that country, through the creation of a canal,
which is expected to increase the prosperity of that city.&nbsp;
Similarly it is suggested that our own town of Nottingham could
be made a great inland port, if water carriage were provided; and
Sir John Turney, before the Royal Commission, has recently (July,
1907) stated that the trade of that town might thus be greatly
increased.&nbsp; These, be it remembered, are not isolated
cases.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p129b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>As to our own local interests, we may reasonably regret that,
after so much money being invested in the Horncastle Canal, and
the serious losses incurred by so many investors, no further
effort should be made to utilize it.&nbsp; The trade of
Horncastle is not so satisfactory but that we might welcome every
adjunct, which could in any way contribute to its furtherance;
while, even from an &aelig;sthetic point of view, it were
desirable that, with the present dilapidated locks, and the banks
in some places broken, the channel, which is in parts little more
than a shallow bed of mud, befouled by garbage and carrion, or
choked by a matted growth of weeds, should be superceded by a
flow of water, pure and emitting no pestiferous exhalations.</p>
<h3><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>THE RAILWAY.</h3>
<p>In few things has there been more remarkable evolution, or we
might even say, revolution, than in our methods of
locomotion.&nbsp; In these days of historic pageants we might
well conceive of a series of scenes passing before us, shewing
the means adopted at different periods, or under different
conditions, in this respect.&nbsp; The war-chariot of Queen
Boadicea, charging the legions of C&aelig;sar, or (in our own
neighbourhood) that of the British warrior Raengeires, routing
his Saxon foes, at Tetford, with their wheels of solid wood and
other massive carpentry, would form a, then inconceivable,
contrast to the future taximeter cab, to be evolved in this 20th
century.</p>
<p>The lumbering &ldquo;wain&rdquo; of the Saxon churl, though
still surviving in the name of a constellation, befitted only an
age little advanced beyond barbarism.</p>
<p>The primitive &ldquo;shout&rdquo; (Dutch
&ldquo;schuyt&rdquo;), or &ldquo;dug-out&rdquo; boat, hollowed by
Celtic flint-axe from the bole of a mighty oak, and slowly
propelled by the almost wild Girvian, through the tangle of fen
morass, had but a remote connection with the steam packet which,
within living memory, plied on the neighbouring Witham, between
Boston and Lincoln.&nbsp; Although the speed of the latter was so
slow, that (as a friend of the writer has done) a pedestrian,
travelling by road, could reach either of those places, from our
town of Horncastle, in less time than it took to go by
carrier&rsquo;s van to Kirkstead wharf, and thence by the said
steamer.</p>
<p>While, again, both these would provoke only a smile of
contempt in the voyager who now crosses the atlantic, at a rate
of 20 knots or more in the hour.&nbsp; Then, again, compare with
these the cyclist, who now flashes past us with the speed of
lightning; or the motorist, who vanishes from our sight, almost
before the dust he has raised is blown away.</p>
<p>Another humbler mode of progress, again, was a familiar sight
in our boyhood, when the farmer&rsquo;s wife jogged contentedly
to market, seated on a pillion, behind her husband, and carrying
her butter, eggs, or chickens, in roomy market baskets by her
side.&nbsp; Even the gig, to carry two, of the better bucolic
class, has now become obsolete, as the train pours out, at the
station, its living stream of market folk, male and female,
within a few minutes of leaving their own doors several miles
away.</p>
<p>As to our country roads we are, it is true, well supplied with
them, but a pageant view of the past, such as we have here
conceived, would reveal to us our British forefathers, toiling,
in wearied gangs, under Roman task-masters, at the forced labour
of road making; by which the town&rsquo;s markets and chartered
fairs were to be accessible, from all directions, for generations
yet unborn.&nbsp; In our present iron ways, we might well suppose
that we have attained the highest evolutionary stage in
expeditious traffic; but who, indeed, shall venture to gainsay,
that as a sequel to our wireless telegraphy, we may one day
eschew the mundane altogether, and become a race of
aeronauts.</p>
<p>The Great Northern loop line, connecting Boston and Lincoln
with Peterborough and Grantham, and so with the further north and
south, was opened in October, 1848.&nbsp; At that date, except
the &ldquo;Navigation&rdquo; for heavy goods, such as corn, coal,
&amp;c., there were only coaches, once a day, for public
conveyance to Boston, Lincoln, Market Rasen, and Louth.&nbsp; But
through the enterprise of Mr. Samuel Sketchley, of Horncastle,
Solicitor, of the old firm of Selwood and Conington, an Act of
Parliament was, not without difficulty, obtained, July 10th,
1854, for the construction of a branch line, running from <!--
page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>Kirkstead to Horncastle; the importance of this event
being recognised by a joyous peal of the parish church bells
being rung, and crowds parading the streets, at 10 o&rsquo;clock
at night, at which hour the news arrived.&nbsp; The next day the
rejoicings were continued, the bells of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church
being again rung, while the tower of the church was adorned with
a tricolour flag, bearing the inscription &ldquo;God speed the
railway,&rdquo; and crowds again passed through the streets,
headed by the town band and a large tricolour standard.</p>
<p>The construction of the line was begun in April of the
following year, 1855; the contractors being Messrs. Smith &amp;
Knight.&nbsp; The original capital of the company was
&pound;48,000, in &pound;10 shares, but the ultimate cost was
about &pound;60,000.&nbsp; The G.N.R. Company undertook the
working, paying half the receipts to the shareholders; and as,
for the distance (about 7&frac12; miles), the expenditure was,
compared with that of many such undertakings, small, so, as an
investment, the enterprise proved a profitable one, few lines
yielding so good a return for the outlay; the &pound;10 shares
still (in 1907) sell at nearly half as much again (&pound;14 17s.
3d., July, 1907).</p>
<p>A brief account may well here be given of the opening ceremony
of this important event in the town&rsquo;s history, condensed
from the public journals of the day.&nbsp; The line was examined
by the Government Inspector, Colonel Wynn, and a few days later
Mr. Seymour Clarke, the G.N.R. manager, stated that it could not
be in a more efficient condition.&nbsp; The opening ceremony was
fixed for Aug. 12th, 1855.&nbsp; At an early hour the town was
crowded with visitors and shops were closed.&nbsp; At 7 a.m.
2,500 lbs. of beef were distributed among the poorer
people.&nbsp; Peals of bells were rung, the Horncastle and
Spilsby bands added their music of popular airs.&nbsp; The
streets and station were profusely decorated, under the direction
of Mr. Crowder, florist, Mr. John Osborne, parish clerk, Mr.
Archbould, head gardener to Sir H. Dymoke, Mr. Nelson from
Stourton Hall, and a local committee.&nbsp; Flags displayed the
arms of the town, those of Sir H. Dymoke, Mr. J. Banks Stanhope,
the Bishop of Carlisle, then lord of the manor, the Rose of
England, and the Union Jack.&nbsp; About noon a procession was
formed in the Bull Ring, to meet the Directors of the G.N.R., by
Mr. F. Harwood, master of the ceremonies, in the following
order:</p>

132</span>The procession marched from the Bull Ring to the
Railway Station, where the elders of the party on the platform,
and the children, with their banners, ranged on the opposite
side, awaited the arrival of the train bringing the G.N.R.
Directors, and as it drew up the bands played &ldquo;See the
Conquering Hero comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The procession, augmented by the directors, then re-formed,
and marched through the town; in the Bull Ring the National
Anthem was sung.&nbsp; A large marquee was erected in the grounds
of Mr. R. C Armstrong (now Mrs. Howland&rsquo;s garden),
adjoining South Street, in which the contractors, Messrs. Smith
&amp; Knight, provided for the directors and shareholders, and
other guests, in all over 200, a splendid dinner, served in
excellent style, by Messrs. Wilson and Serpell, of the Bull
Hotel.&nbsp; The Honble. Sir H. Dymoke presided, as Chairman of
the Horncastle and Kirkstead Railway Co.; being supported on his
right by Mr. Hussey Packe and Mr. C. Chaplin, Directors of the
G.N.R., Major Amcotts and Sir M. J. Cholmeley, and on his left by
J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., M.P., Director of the Horncastle
Railway, and Rev. W. H. Milner, Vicar.&nbsp; Congratulatory
speeches were made, and the day closed with a fine display of
fireworks.</p>
<p>Opened under such favourable auspices, and supplying a felt
need, the railway has continued to be a success; improvements
have been made, from time to time, in the stations at Horncastle
and Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; The line continues to be a single one,
but it is sufficient for the local requirements, and the shares,
as before mentioned, at the present time (1907) find a ready sale
at an advance of about 50 per cent. on their original
price.&nbsp; We might add that if the railway could be continued
to Spilsby, and then connected with the different lines running
to the Skegness, Mablethorpe and other health resorts on the
coast, its utility, and doubtless its paying value, would be
largely increased, as it would shorten the distance by many
miles.</p>

WORKHOUSE OR UNION.</h2>
<p>We now notice the chief of those public institutions, and the
buildings connected therewith, which have been established in the
town, within more recent times, for its welfare, or its
adornment; in order to bring its corporate efficiency into more
complete accord with the advanced requirements of what may be
called modern municipal life.&nbsp; Among these the foremost
place, from its general importance, is naturally due to the
Union, or Workhouse; and here it is necessary to make some
preliminary remarks.</p>
<p>The workhouse, or union, for a large district is a
comparatively recent creation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor&rdquo; we
have had &ldquo;always with&rdquo; us, but they have not always
been dealt with as they now are.&nbsp; By statute 23 Edward III.
(1349), it was enacted that &ldquo;none should give alms to a
beggar who was able to work.&rdquo;&nbsp; By common law the
really deserving poor were to be assisted &ldquo;by parsons and
parishioners, so that none should die for default of
sustenance.&rdquo;&nbsp; By Act, 15 Richard II. (1392),
impropriators (<i>i.e.</i> laymen holding church property) were
bound to contribute a certain yearly sum to the poor of the
parish, but no compulsory law was passed till 27 Henry VIII.
(1536).&nbsp; The present poor law system dates from 43 Eliz.
(1601); successive amendment acts being passed from 1836 to 1847,
and again in 1861; and a further relief act in 1862.</p>
<p>At first parishes regulated their own methods and amounts of
relief.&nbsp; For a long period, indeed, the labouring class were
subject to strict legal rules, both as to service, and in their
individual movements.&nbsp; It was quite an innovation when, in
23 Henry VI. (1445), a servant was permitted to change masters
after giving due notice; and when moving, or, as it is locally
called, &ldquo;flitting,&rdquo; from one parish to another, for
employment, he had to produce a certificate of settlement from
his last abode.&nbsp; In such matters the overseers were
paramount, until their powers were transferred to the newly
constituted guardians of the poor, by Act of Parliament, in 1839.
<a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>The &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; preceded the
&ldquo;union,&rdquo; which latter term was adopted when parishes,
throughout a large district, were <i>united</i> for the purposes
of poor relief. <a name="citation134a"></a><a
href="#footnote134a" class="citation">[134a]</a>&nbsp; In some
cases a country parish had its own workhouse.&nbsp; For instance,
old parish books of Thimbleby, <a name="citation134b"></a><a
href="#footnote134b" class="citation">[134b]</a> show that in
1819 &pound;20 was spent upon the village workhouse, which was
insured for &pound;200.</p>
<p>Among some old churchwardens&rsquo; records, in the possession
of Mr. John Overton, of Horncastle (members of whose family have
frequently held that office), it is mentioned that early in the
18th century a &ldquo;public oven&rdquo; was erected in the town
to enable the poor to cook their meals, or to bake the
&ldquo;black bread,&rdquo; then in common use, <a
name="citation134c"></a><a href="#footnote134c"
class="citation">[134c]</a> more conveniently than they could at
home. <a name="citation134d"></a><a href="#footnote134d"
class="citation">[134d]</a>&nbsp; At a later date (1780) a
spinning school was established by public rate, to help the poor
to earn a livelihood by a home industry. <a
name="citation134e"></a><a href="#footnote134e"
class="citation">[134e]</a></p>
<p>An important advance was made in poor relief, in 1735, when,
as the same records state, &ldquo;on April 17 a committee was
appointed, <a name="citation134f"></a><a href="#footnote134f"
class="citation">[134f]</a> in Horncastle, to build a
workhouse,&rdquo; and on May 7th in the following year a brief
note gives the cost of the building as being &pound;175 13s.
4d.&nbsp; This was situated on the east side of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Square, separated by a few yards from the Grammar School, the
site being now (1908) occupied by a common lodging house.&nbsp;
It continued to be the public workhouse for over 100 years; and
that the poor, who needed relief, were generally expected to
enter as inmates, is shewn by another brief note, in the same
records, to the following effect: &ldquo;May 2nd, 1781.&nbsp; Out
payments discontinued, except in sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not till 1838 that the present workhouse, in Foundry
Street, was built, from the designs of Mr.&mdash;afterwards
Sir&mdash;Gilbert Scott, being one of his earliest undertakings
<a name="citation134g"></a><a href="#footnote134g"
class="citation">[134g]</a>&nbsp; It is a commodious structure,
capable of accommodating <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>260
inmates; and, with grounds attached, covers an area of between
four and five acres.&nbsp; It is now known as &ldquo;The
Union,&rdquo; and the union district embraces 69 parishes,
represented by 76 guardians, to whom, as already stated, the
former duties of the overseers were transferred in 1839.</p>
<p>The Rev. Canon A. E. Moore is the present Chaplain.</p>
<h3>THE COURT HOUSE.</h3>
<p>The majesty of the law has not always been so worthily
domiciled in Horncastle as during the last forty years.&nbsp; In
Stukeley&rsquo;s map of the town, dated 1722, the Sessions House
is placed at the south-east corner of the &ldquo;Mercat
Place,&rdquo; where there now (1908) stands a small refreshment
house.&nbsp; The cells for prisoners probably formed the basement
of this building, as there is no known record of their being
confined elsewhere, until the year 1821, when what was called the
&ldquo;Round House&rdquo; was built, at the north-east corner of
the Market Place, opposite the present Lord Nelson Inn.&nbsp;
This was a small circular building, having two cells, with a
colonnade running round it, which formed a shelter for market
women selling butter, eggs, &amp;c.&nbsp; The foundations of this
structure were so shallow that it is on record that a prisoner,
in the course of one night, scratched a passage under the wall
and effected his escape. <a name="citation135"></a><a
href="#footnote135" class="citation">[135]</a>&nbsp; This prison
was demolished in 1853, when the present police station <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>was built, facing the Wong, at a cost of &pound;500,
having four cells, for 12 prisoners, and a residence for a
superintendent and constable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p135b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Some years later fresh premises were rented for the
magistrates, on the south side of the High Street, adjoining the
George Hotel, now extinct, though then a leading
establishment.&nbsp; That site is now occupied by the Lincoln and
Lindsey Bank.</p>
<p>In 1843 the magistrates&rsquo; office was transferred to what
is now 19, Bull Ring, part of the shop of Messrs. Robinson,
Drapers.&nbsp; All these premises proving inadequate for their
purpose, the present Court House was built in 1865, on the site
of the former parish stocks, the site, a slight rising ground,
being called &ldquo;Stocks&rsquo; Hill,&rdquo; at a cost of
&pound;3,000.&nbsp; The architect was Mr. C. Reeves, of London,
the builder Mr. Huddleston, of Lincoln.&nbsp; The furniture was
supplied by Messrs. Pike &amp; Wright, of Horncastle; gas
fittings by Mr. Murrell, of Chelsea.</p>
<p>In this handsome building, of white brick, there is
accommodation for many branches of public, local and county
business.&nbsp; As a possession the Court House is the property
of the Board of Works, in London, the county authorities paying
to them a rent of &pound;10, for the use of it by the
magistrates.</p>
<h3>THE STANHOPE MEMORIAL.</h3>
<p>This handsome structure was erected under the following
circumstances.&nbsp; The Right Honble. Edward Stanhope, who had
represented the Horncastle Division in Parliament, with much
distinction, from the year 1874, died rather suddenly, as the
result of hard work, in his official capacity, on Dec. 22, 1893,
to the great grief of the entire constituency; when it was
universally felt that his services merited some public
recognition.&nbsp; Various meetings were held, and at length, on
Jan. 22nd, 1897, at a gathering in the Masonic Hall, a committee
was appointed to carry out the scheme.&nbsp; The design of the
Memorial was intrusted to the architect, Mr. E. H. Lingen Barker,
of Hereford, Messrs. Walter &amp; Hensman, of Horncastle, being
the contractors for the work.</p>
<p>The ceremony of inauguration was performed by J. Banks
Stanhope, Esq., formerly M.P. for the Division, on Feb. 2nd,
1899, in the presence of the Earl and Countess Stanhope, and
other distinguished persons on the platform, and a vast crowd
from the neighbourhood filling the entire Market Place.&nbsp;
This was followed by a public luncheon in the Corn Exchange.</p>
<p>The site chosen was the centre of the Market Place, as that,
along with the market dues, had been made over to the town as a
free gift, by the Right Honble. gentleman, as Lord of the
Manor.&nbsp; The following is the official description of the
monument, as published at the time of its erection.&nbsp; The
structure is 31-ft. 6-in. in height.&nbsp; It stands on a massive
foundation of concrete; with three tiers of Yorkshire stone
steps, each 15-in. wide, running round the base leading up to the
monument proper, their shape being octagonal.&nbsp; With the
exception of two strings of Dumfries&rsquo; red stone, the lower
part is of Monk&rsquo;s Park stone.&nbsp; Above this is a moulded
string course, and on each face are shafts of Aberdeen red
granite, with moulded caps and bases.&nbsp; The panels are filled
with diaper work; and in each alternate panel are arms of the
Stanhope family, and the arms of the town, with an inscription to
the memory of the Right Honble. E. Stanhope, and a medallion,
with bust, in relief, of the same.&nbsp; These panels are
surmounted by moulded and carved cinquefoil panels, surmounted by
carved finials.&nbsp; Above these, again, are eight <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>columns of polished granite, supporting the
superstructure, and these also have eight trefoil dormers,
simpler than those below, each finished with a finial of gun
metal.&nbsp; Above these are eight gun metal columns, having
trefoiled heads, with foliated finials and moulded cornice; and
on these rests the spirette, constructed of oak and covered with
lead, with eight other dormers, which complete the whole.&nbsp;
The total cost was &pound;552 12s. 3d., raised by subscriptions,
a small balance being handed over to the public Dispensary.</p>
<h3>THE CLERICAL CLUB.</h3>
<p>The Clerical Club was founded in 1822; a room was rented on
the premises of Mr. James Babington, Bookseller, in the High
Street (now occupied by Mr. J. S. Balding, Butcher), where the
members met for discussion, and gradually established a good
library.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The first members enrolled were the Rev. the Hon. the
King&rsquo;s Champion, John Dymoke, Rector of Scrivelsby; the
Revs. J. B. Smith, Head Master of the Grammar School; C. N.
L&rsquo;Oste, Rector of Claxby; Francis Rockliffe, Rector of
Fulletby; Robert Spranger, D.D., Rector of Low Toynton (and of
Grosvenor Street, Grosvenor Square, London); John Mounsey, Rector
of Gautby; Thomas Roe, Rector of Kirkby-on-Bain; E. Brackenbury,
Rector of Aswardby; W. Dodson, Rector of Well; F. Swan, Rector of
Sausthorpe; and others holding benefices scattered over a wide
area, but several of them living in Horncastle.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>The Club was formally opened in the following year,
when several more members were added; the Honble. John Dymoke
being elected President, Dr. Clement Madeley, Vicar of
Horncastle, Vice-President, with Dr. J. B. Smith as Secretary, in
which capacity he did valuable service, in increasing the
membership and adding to the efficiency of the institution, which
flourished for many years.</p>
<p>In later times, especially on the lamented death of Dr. Smith,
and the creation of circulating libraries, such as that of
Messrs. Mudie, in London, the numbers of subscribers fell off
considerably.&nbsp; The books were transferred to various
quarters; at first to the house of the late Mr. John Osborne,
parish clerk, himself no mean scholar and student, afterwards to
the residence of the head master of the Grammar School, where
they remained for some years, under successive masters, still
available for members of the club.</p>
<p>On June 8th, 1892, Canon Quarrington, Vicar of Horncastle,
Revs. J. C. Hudson, Vicar of Thornton, and J. Conway Walter,
Rector of Langton, were appointed a sub-committee, with
instructions to find a permanent club room, or to give the books
to the Lincoln Diocesan Library.&nbsp; In September of that year
Dr. Madge, Head Master, offered to keep the books, to act as
Librarian, and admit members to them two or three days a week in
his house.</p>
<p>In January, 1893, the present writer was commissioned with Dr.
Madge, to examine the books, when there was found to be 799 in
good condition, 69 missing.&nbsp; The Secretary of the Lincoln
Diocesan Library was communicated with, and at a meeting of the
committee of that library, held on Feb. 24, 1893, the offer of
the books was accepted, and they were in due course transferred
to that institution.</p>
<p>On May 17th, 1894, the Rev. J. Conway Walter, with three
others, was commissioned to obtain a supply of books from a
circulating library at Lincoln.&nbsp; Eventually Mudie&rsquo;s
library was established at the shop of Mr. H. Willson,
Bookseller, Horncastle; Mr. W. K. Morton opened a subscription
library, and Messrs. W. H. Smith opened a book stall at the
station.&nbsp; These three still continue: the original Clerical
Club books being still available, with others, at the library in
the Chapter House of Lincoln Cathedral.</p>
<p>There was at one time a <i>Literary Society</i> in Horncastle,
which used to meet at the Bull Hotel, in a small room, now the
bar, beneath the large ball room, on a level with the
street.&nbsp; Among the most active members of this was John
Brown, the late, so-called, Horncastle &ldquo;Poet
Laureate,&rdquo; whose poems were published in 1890, by the Rev.
J. Conway Walter, in a volume entitled <i>Liter&aelig;
Laureat&aelig;</i>, dedicated to Lord Tennyson.&nbsp; Another
prominent member was the late Mr. Thomas Baker, who was an
amateur actor and clever ventriloquist, as well as a great
cricketer.&nbsp; In his early years he was engaged by the father
of Sir Evelyn Wood to teach the village boys cricket in
Essex.&nbsp; His bowling was of the old roundhand style; in which
he bowled to Fuller Pilch, the greatest batsman of his day; and
also to Dr. W. G. Grace, now of the Crystal Palace; and, many
years ago, in a match against a crack 11, including three
University players and one professional, he bowled them all out
for 11 runs.&nbsp; He also bowled out the captain of the All
England Eleven with his first ball.&nbsp; He died Feb. 12th,
1903, aged 88.</p>
<h3><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>THE MECHANICS&rsquo; INSTITUTE.</h3>
<p>Mechanics&rsquo; Institutes were first established in the
earlier half of the 19th century.&nbsp; The first known was that
founded in London by the famous Dr. Birkbeck in 1823; another
being opened in the same year in Glasgow; after which they became
general.&nbsp; As Horncastle was in advance of other towns in the
county in its valuable Dispensary (see p. 119), so it would seem
to have preceded other towns, with the exception of Lincoln, in
catering for the growing taste for literature.&nbsp; The
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute was founded in the year 1834.&nbsp; It
was first located in Union Street, now called Queen Street, and
soon received the support of all classes.&nbsp; The building,
which consisted of one large room, was situated on the west side
of the street, on the site where now stands the private
residence, No. 18.</p>
<p>Soon after the erection of the Corn Exchange, in 1856, the
Mechanics&rsquo; Institute was transferred to that building; two
upper rooms being occupied, as library and reading room; the
former premises in Queen Street being sold to the late Mr. Joseph
Parish, who used them for sales, public meetings, dances, and so
forth, until in 1866 he erected on the site a private residence
for himself.</p>
<p>After some years the introduction of the above named branch of
the popular London Library of Messrs. Mudie &amp; Co., at the
shop of Mr. Hugh Willson, Bookseller, in the Bull Ring, followed
by the subscription library of Mr. W. K. Morton, in the High
Street, and that of Messrs. W. H. Smith &amp; Sons, at the
Railway Station, reduced the numbers of the subscribers to
&ldquo;The Mechanics,&rdquo; and it was removed to smaller
premises in Bank Street; and eventually this same cause led to
the Institute being closed.&nbsp; On January 14th, 1886, a
meeting was held in the library to determine its future, the
result being that the Secretary, Mr. W. Betts, and the members of
the committee resigned, Jan. 21st, and the books, &amp;c., were
removed to a small chamber at the Gas House, in Foundry Street,
another small room there being used as a temporary reading
room.&nbsp; These were closed about the year 1894, the books
remaining stowed away.&nbsp; About the year 1899 an effort was
made by the late W. Brown, of the Capital and Counties&rsquo;
Bank, to get the books transferred to the Technical School in
Queen Street, of the committee of which he was chairman; with the
object that they might be once more rendered available for public
use; but this project fell through.</p>
<p>In 1905 the library was finally broken up by the late Mr.
Joseph Willson, the last survivor of the Managing Committee, who
sold the less valuable among the books by auction in Lincoln, the
rest being divided between the permanent subscription library of
Mr. W. K. Morton, Bookseller, High Street, and that of the
Grammar School.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that a valuable collection of books
thus ceased to be public property.&nbsp; A catalogue of the
library, published by Mr. W. Johnson, Bookseller, High Street, in
1865, shows that the number of volumes was at that date 1,468,
with annual additions; while in 1879 a bequest was made by the
late Henry James Fielding, Esq., of Handel House, South Street,
of about 230 volumes of standard works, bringing the total up to
about 1,750 volumes.&nbsp; (Classified List, published by W. K.
Morton, 1879.)</p>
<p>The first librarian was Mrs. Wood, assisted by her daughter
(afterwards Mrs. Panton).&nbsp; She was succeeded by Miss South,
who was followed by Miss Stephenson, and she was succeeded by
Mrs. W. Johnson.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>The late Mr. Henry Nicholson acted as secretary, and
for several years took a great interest in all that concerned the
Institute, until his prolonged serious illness, which ended
fatally in June, 1900.&nbsp; Mr. C. Hensman was treasurer while
the library was at the Corn Exchange, resigning when it was
removed to Banks Street.&nbsp; During the same period the late
Mr. Berridge, Master of the Union, acted as Secretary, and was
succeeded by Mr. W. Betts, of the Dispensary, who only held that
post two years, before the Institute was closed.</p>
<p>There were in the library, besides the books, a quantity of
weapons of war from the South Sea Islands, some cases of objects
of natural history; valuable sepia paintings by the late Rev. C.
P. Terrot, of Wispington, an almost unrivalled artist in his own
line; and several fine Roman vases exhumed in the town; all these
were disposed of by Mr. Joseph Willson, only surviving trustee,
now deceased.</p>
<h3>THE CORN EXCHANGE.</h3>
<p>The Corn Exchange is a spacious and lofty building of brick,
with stone facings, capable of holding 500 persons, situated on
the south side of the High Street, and standing on what was
formerly the eastern wall of the old Roman castle; a well of pure
water, still in use, under the adjoining house, having been just
within the wall of that fortress.&nbsp; It was opened on July
5th, 1856.&nbsp; From the terms of the original deed of
settlement of the company we may give the following items.</p>
<p>The Indenture, dated July 18th, 1855, was registered the 31st
of the same month; the agreement being, on the first part,
between Thomas Armstrong, Merchant; Henry Turner, Land Agent;
George Wright, Merchant; Henry Nicholson, Draper; William Preston
Carlton, Chemist; and others, all of Horncastle; with certain
residents in the neighbourhood on the second part; and Frederick
W. Tweed, of Horncastle, Gentleman, as trustee to give effect to
the covenant, on the third part.&nbsp; The said parties agree to
form themselves a Joint Stock Company, within the meaning of the
Act 7 and 8 Victoria, c. 110, to provide a building for the
purposes, according to these presents, viz., a Corn Exchange,
which can also be used for concerts, exhibitions, and other
public objects, on such terms as the committee may think fit.</p>
<p>The capital of the company to be &pound;3,000, in 600 shares
of &pound;5 each; annual meetings of shareholders to be held on
May 2nd; any five, or more, owning 25 shares, may require the
directors to convene an extraordinary meeting.&nbsp; The capital
may be increased by additional shares of &pound;5, not exceeding
300; money may be borrowed on mortgage, not exceeding at any one
time &pound;1,500. <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a>&nbsp; One-third of
the original directors to retire in May, 1856, being eligible for
re-election.&nbsp; In May, 1857, one-half of the remaining
original directors to retire; and similarly in succeeding years
one-third to retire in rotation, according to seniority.&nbsp;
Any director to forfeit office on ceasing to hold five shares;
anyone intending to apply for directorate, to give at least 10
days&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; Directors to meet at least once every
three months; any two directors may require the secretary to
convene a meeting, at any time, for any desirable special
object.</p>
<p>The Court of Directors to apply to the Privy Council (Board of
Trade) <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>for permission to purchase, or rent,
land or buildings, as may seem to be needed; or to let, or lease,
buildings, offices, &amp;c., as they may think fit; or to make
mortgages, conveyances, &amp;c., for the purposes of the
company.&nbsp; A reserve fund (by clause 67) to be established,
by setting apart one per cent of the profits in any year; the
accumulation to be employed for the benefit of the company, as
may seem to them desirable.&nbsp; Shares to be sold (by clause
68) for the benefit of the company, by a vote of a majority at a
general meeting.&nbsp; No sum beyond &pound;400, at any one time,
to be negotiated by promissory note or bill of exchange.</p>

nominated in accordance with Act 7 and 8 Victoria, c. 110.&nbsp;
By clause 89 it was provided that, in case of the company being

<p>On Nov. 6th, 1889, a meeting was held to consider whether the
company should be wound up; but it was decided to continue it,
and of late years the financial position of the company has
improved; the report for 1906 shews total receipts for the past
year, &pound;145 13s. 1d.; expenditure &pound;87 2s. 10d.;
leaving balance &pound;58 10s. 3d.; allowing a dividend of
&pound;1 10s. per cent., the sum of &pound;6 0s. 3d. being still
in hand.&nbsp; Offices on the same premises are rented by Mr.
Reuben Roberts, Corn Merchant.</p>
<h3>THE WHELPTON ALMSHOUSES.</h3>
<p>The Whelpton Almshouses are situated in Queen Street, on its
east side, being six small residences, for the reception of
deserving poor persons, natives of the town.&nbsp; They were
established in the year 1861, under the following
circumstances.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Geo. Whelpton was a shoemaker, occupying a small
shop, one of several then standing in the Market Place, on or
near the site of the present Stanhope Memorial; <a
name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a"
class="citation">[142a]</a> the whole of these being cleared away
when the late Honble. Edward Stanhope presented that piece of
ground to the town, for the enlargement of the Market
Place.&nbsp; He resided in a small house in Stonewell Row, but
afterwards removed into better premises in Queen Street.&nbsp;
While living in Stonewell Row he purchased some furniture cheap,
at an auction, and in a drawer of one of the articles purchased
he found a recipe, said to have been written by a Boston doctor,
for the medicine eventually to become known universally as
&ldquo;Whelpton&rsquo;s Pills&rdquo; (a powerful stomachic, for
kidney diseases, &amp;c.), and from the sale of which he and
other members of his family realised large fortunes. <a
name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"
class="citation">[142b]</a>&nbsp; His wife had been for some time
in a bad state of health, and after she had consulted various
doctors without deriving any benefit from their treatment, he
decided to try for her the prescription which had thus
accidentally come into his possession.&nbsp; The result was so
satisfactory that other sufferers applied to him for the pills,
which for a time he freely gave to his neighbours; ultimately,
however, these applications became so numerous that he was
obliged to make a charge.</p>
<p>As he began to realise a considerable income from this source,
he gave up the shoemaking business, and left Horncastle; his
first move being to Derby, <a name="citation142c"></a><a
href="#footnote142c" class="citation">[142c]</a> where he
occupied a residence known as &ldquo;St. Anne&rsquo;s
House,&rdquo; afterwards moving to London, where he, at first,
lived in Crane Court, Fleet Street, which still continues to be
the depot of the pill business.&nbsp; He subsequently <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>moved to a better part of the metropolis, taking up his
residence at 1, Albert Road, Regent&rsquo;s Park, where he
remained for several years, until he finally settled in Warrior
Square, Hastings.</p>
<p>While residing in London his wife <a
name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a"
class="citation">[143a]</a> had another illness, from which she
eventually died, in 1859; and feeling her loss very acutely he
decided, after a time, to erect the almshouses to her memory. <a
name="citation143b"></a><a href="#footnote143b"

</a></p>
<p>Among the documents preserved in connection with this charity,
is the original letter of George Whelpton, dated March 18, 1861,
giving instructions that the building of the almshouses should be
immediately taken in hand.&nbsp; The Indenture itself is dated
March 21st, 1861, and among its terms are the following:
&ldquo;This agreement is between Richard Clitherow, of
Horncastle, Gentleman, surviving trustee and executor of the will
of Samuel Curtis Lomas, late of Blencogo, Co. Cumberland,
Surgeon, of the first part; George Whelpton, of No. 1, Albert
Road, Regent&rsquo;s Park, Middlesex, of the second part; and
William Thompson Whelpton, of No. 69, Gloucester Crescent,
Regent&rsquo;s Park, Middlesex, Gent., and Rev. Henry Robert
Whelpton, of Upton Park, Slough, <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>Bucks., on
the third part.&rdquo;&nbsp; In accordance with this agreement
certain lands comprising, with others, the future site of the
almshouses, situated on the east side of what was then called
Union Street, the property of the said Samuel Curtis Lomas, were
acquired through the said Mr. Richard Clitherow, for Mr. G.
Whelpton, for the purposes of the charity, with the above
relatives as co-trustees.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;1,000 was also
conveyed as endowment of the charity, to the trustees.</p>
<p>It was provided by the agreement that the inmates of the
houses should be selected from persons who were fit and deserving
subjects of the charity, indigent, but of good character, not
recipients of parish relief, and not under 45 years of age; and
that any, becoming guilty of immorality, should forfeit their
privileges.&nbsp; The power of selection of inmates was vested in
the trustees, assisted by the vicar and churchwardens of the
parish; a clause being added, that, in case of the trustees being
incompetent, by reason of infancy or idiocy, the vicar and
churchwardens should select.&nbsp; The weekly allowance to the
inmates was to be 3s. 6d.</p>
<p>The agreement to this effect was signed, sealed, and
delivered, by the said George Whelpton, in the presence of
Richard Clitherow, Solicitor, and Charles Dee, Solicitor, both of
Horncastle.&nbsp; It was further signed by George Whelpton and
William Thompson Whelpton, in the presence of Robert Cunliffe,
Solicitor, of 43, Chancery Lane, London; and by Henry Robert
Whelpton, in the presence of John Adams Cree, Clerk in Holy
Orders, of Upton Park, Slough, Bucks.&nbsp; Appended is a
receipt, signed by Richard Clitherow, and witnessed by Charles
Dee, shewing that, at the date of the Indenture, the sum of
&pound;101 5s. was paid by George Whelpton for the purchase of
the site of the almshouses.</p>
<p>This agreement was examined on Feb. 7th, 1888, in the Court of
Justice, London, before Mr. Justice Chitty, on an enquiry being
made as to the estate of William Thompson Whelpton, deceased, at
the instance of the Rev. Henry Robert Whelpton, and Stephen
Whelpton; when the Court declared that the direction in the will
of the testator, as to the endowment of the charity, was a
&ldquo;valid charitable bequest of &pound;1,000,&rdquo; and the
money &ldquo;invested in three per cents.&nbsp; Consols, for the
following purposes&rdquo;: (1) for the repair of the alms-houses;
(2) to pay each occupant 3s. 6d. per week; (3) in case of there
being any surplus, to pay them so much more as the trustees
should think fit.&nbsp; A clause was added, empowering the
Charity Commissioners, from time to time, to order any part of
the income to be applied to special purposes, as they might think
desirable.</p>
<p>We may add that while residing at Hastings, Mr. George
Whelpton secured two acres of land, at Eastbourne, from the Duke
of Devonshire, the owner of the whole town, as he is also of
Buxton; and at a cost of about &pound;20,000, erected and endowed
the church and vicarage of St. Saviour&rsquo;s, which was held by
his youngest son, Henry Robert, who graduated at St. John&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge, and was afterwards made Canon of
Chichester.&nbsp; This benefice is private property, and is now
held by his son, Henry Urling Whelpton, of Pembroke College,
Cambridge.</p>
<p>The head of the Whelpton family may now be considered to be
the Rev. George Whelpton, at one time residing in France, but now
of Trinity House, Abington, Berks.&nbsp; The original George
Whelpton died in 1903.</p>
<p>For these details the present writer is indebted to several
members of the Whelpton family, with some of whom he was a fellow
pupil at the Horncastle Grammar School.</p>
<h3><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>THE DRILL HALL.</h3>
<p>The present building is not the first structure erected in
connection with the Volunteers, any more than the present
Volunteers themselves are the first institution of the kind
formed in Horncastle.&nbsp; In the early years of the 19th
century, when there was a general feeling abroad that one great
project, nurtured in the ambitious mind of the first Napoleon,
was an invasion of England, volunteers were organized throughout
the country, with a view to self-defence.&nbsp; As an instance of
this, in the town of Pontefract a corps was formed, of which the
Earl of Mexborough was Colonel Commandant, and George Pyemont,
Esq., of Tanshelf House, Pontefract (grandfather of the present
writer), was Major; <a name="citation145"></a><a
href="#footnote145" class="citation">[145]</a> the records of
which are preserved, among other public documents, in Pontefract
Castle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

src="images/p145s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Similarly, a corps was raised in Horncastle at the same
period, of which we have somewhat curious evidence in the
following.&nbsp; There exists a small pamphlet, which the writer
has recently (July, 1908) perused, entitled &ldquo;An address
delivered to the Horncastle Volunteers, on Feb. 26, 1804, by
their chaplain, in consequence of the resignation of some of the
members.&nbsp; Published by desire of the corps.&nbsp; Printed by
James Weir, Horncastle, 1804.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this address he
expresses his great regret that so many volunteers are resigning
<!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>&ldquo;after putting the country to the expense of
supplying them with clothing and arms, having also pledged
themselves to the country&rsquo;s defence, and received in return
exemption from militia service,&rdquo; this too at a time when
(as he says) &ldquo;we are in danger of being reduced to a French
province.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No resignations (he continues) have
taken place in London, in Boston, or in Spilsby.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
reminds them that they (the Horncastrians) had been &ldquo;among
the first in the county to offer their services,&rdquo; and he
urges them still to &ldquo;maintain their character&rdquo; for
loyalty.</p>
<p>In consequence of this appeal a public meeting was called
together, at which was formed a &ldquo;Court of Enquiry,&rdquo;
consisting of &ldquo;9 members, 3 elected from the officers of
the corps, and 6 from the non-commissioned officers and privates,
to whom all proposals of resignation should be
submitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; In subsequent pages regulations are added
as to keeping their weapons in proper condition, orders as to
loading their guns, &amp;c., which are described as
&ldquo;firelocks&rdquo; with &ldquo;flints.&rdquo;&nbsp; This we
may regard as an interesting item of past local history,
evidencing the spirit in which the first Horncastle Volunteers
were formed.</p>
<p>The modern volunteer movement originated in the year 1859,
under somewhat similar circumstances to the earlier
movement.&nbsp; Notwithstanding our ultimate victory in the
Crimean war, it was felt that our blunders had been most serious,
and our military organization far from complete.&nbsp; War, as a
science, was assuming new forms; steam was giving to navigation
an independence of wind and tide, which might lead to invasion
unawares.&nbsp; The state of our defences was considered most
unsatisfactory.&nbsp; France was our ally, but the Emperor
Napoleon III. only ruled by popular suffrage, and the memories of
Waterloo still affected the sentiments of his people towards
England.&nbsp; The facility with which England might be invaded
was a subject of discussion in parliament in the course of the
session of that year.&nbsp; Lord Palmerston held the view that
France could, within a few hours, bring together an army, which
could land on our shores and march upon London, before we were
awake to the danger.&nbsp; It was our duty to be ready for
defence against any such surprise, and it was said that
&ldquo;our friend&rdquo; Napoleon would himself welcome such
preparedness on our part, as giving him the best arguments with
his own subjects against any such enterprise.</p>
<p>Strengthened by such reasoning, the Earl of Ripon, Under
Secretary for War, announced that volunteer corps would be
enrolled throughout the country.&nbsp; The government plans were
published on the first of July, were warmly accepted by all
parties, and a circular was issued, dated July 13th, to all the
Lieutenants of counties, urging immediate action; and forthwith
the &ldquo;nation of shopkeepers&rdquo; were, as by magic,
transformed into an armed camp.&nbsp; So rapid was the progress
that by June of the following year the cry was &ldquo;Ready, aye!
ready;&rdquo; and on the 23rd of that month the Queen held a
review in Hyde Park, at which some 20,000 volunteers passed
before her.&nbsp; We are told, as a curious incident, that at
that review there was present as a newly enrolled private, a Mr.
Tower, of Wealdhall, Essex, who had also been present, as a
private, at a review held under the former system in 1803. <a
name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a></p>
<p>The loyal town of Horncastle was not behindhand; a public
meeting was held in the Bull Hotel, on Aug. 10th, 1859, for the
purpose of organizing a <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Rifle
Corps, for the district, at which the Deputy Lieutenant
attended.&nbsp; Among those present were Major Smart, of Tumby,
J. Wadham Floyer, of Martin Hall, H. F. Conington, Clarence
House, Horncastle, Dr. B. J. Boulton, Dr. W. Ward, Messrs. W. S.
Clitherow, R. C. Armstrong, E. Babington, F. Gilliat, F. W.
Tweed, J. R. Banks, and most of the chief tradesmen and residents
in town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The Muster Roll, which is still preserved, of the corps then
formed, and designated the &ldquo;G Company of the 1st Battalion
of the Lincolnshire Regiment of Volunteers,&rdquo; has at its
head the name of Henry Francis Conington, as Captain, March 9th,
1860, with Richard W. Clitherow and Robert Jalland, as officers
under him, at the same date; then follows a long list of
non-commissioned officers and privates, numbering, in the course
of a few years, more than 2,000 names.&nbsp; Captain Conington,
promoted Major in 1870, was succeeded in due course, on his going
abroad, by Captain, afterwards Major, Robert Clifton Armstrong,
who had begun service as Sergeant, and then Lieutenant; having
under him, as Lieutenants, Messrs. W. Jeffery and W. S.
Clitherow, who were succeeded by Richard W. Clitherow and Robert
C. Isle; with Dr. Hugh George as surgeon.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Ellwood, of Mareham-le-Fen, who had joined the
corps in 1865, succeeded to the command in 1891, with Dr. Keogh,
of Coningsby, and <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>F. S. Dymoke, Esq., as Lieutenants,
Dr. Hugh George still acting as Surgeon; Ellwood was promoted as
Captain in 1891, succeeded to the Colonelcy of the head-quarters
staff in 1894, and is now Hon. Colonel of the Battalion, entitled
to wear the regimental uniform.</p>
<p>In 1894 Mr. H. Tweed succeeded to the command as Captain, with
Messrs. T. Levett and Granville Sharpe acting as Lieutenants (Mr.
F. W. S. Heywood, of Holbeach Hall, being temporarily
attached).&nbsp; In 1899 Granville Sharpe succeeded to the
command, but his health failing, he resigned after a year&rsquo;s
service.&nbsp; He was succeeded in 1900 by Dr. J. W. Jessop as
Captain, who had joined in 1895, and was in 1906 promoted Major
of the Battalion; A. A. Ellwood becoming Lieutenant.&nbsp; Dr.
Herbert A. Howes, who had joined in 1900, succeeded in 1906 to
the command, which he still holds, 1908.</p>
<p>Senior officers in command of the Battalion have been Col.
Amcotts (deceased), Col. Seddon (deceased), Col. Preston
(deceased), Col. J. G. Williams of Lincoln, and at present Col.
J. Ruston of Lincoln.&nbsp; Clergy who have served as Chaplains
have been Revs. S. Lodge; C. Reginald Blathwayt, Vicar of West
Ashby; A. Scrivenor, Vicar of Horncastle; H. Benwell; and at the
present time (1908) Paul O. Ashby, Incumbent of Revesby.</p>
<p>Among those who have done good service in the corps, we should
mention the first Drill Sergeant Beeton, who had previously
served in the 22nd Regiment of the Line (the Old Cheshire), and
afterwards in the South Lincolnshire Militia, as Colour
Sergeant.&nbsp; He drilled the corps during about 20 years; dying
in Horncastle, after about 40 years service.&nbsp; He was
followed by Sergt. Major Bartlett; then by Sergeant Doggett, who
had been Colour Sergeant in the 1st Royal Sussex, and previously
to that in the 2nd Battalion of the North Staffordshire Regiment
(the old 98th).&nbsp; He still resides in Horncastle.&nbsp; In
later years the post has been held by Sergeants Towne, Ashley and
Bamber.</p>
<p>As to the buildings connected with the volunteers, their
history is briefly this: In the early years of the corps&rsquo;
existence drill was carried on in the Corn Exchange.&nbsp; After
a time the building adjoining the north-east corner of the Wong,
which had been a British School, was secured; and this, after
structural renovation, was used for several years as the
head-quarters.&nbsp; It is now in the occupation of Messrs. Danby
and Cheseldine, Coach Builders; as in 1901 a new site was
obtained at the south-east corner of the Wong, and here on the
13th day of June in that year the foundation stone of the present
Drill Hall was laid, with much ceremony, by the Earl of
Yarborough, supported by other public functionaries.&nbsp; We
here give, in full, the official programme of the proceedings,
which may be worthy of preservation, in memory of this important
occasion.</p>

HORNCASTLE WORTHIES, &amp;c.</h2>
<h3>MISS ANNIE DIXON.</h3>
<p>Miss Annie Dixon, the artist, was a native of Horncastle of
whom the town may well be proud.&nbsp; She was the eldest
daughter of a corn chandler, living on the Spilsby Road, now
called East Street; he had two sons and five daughters.&nbsp; We
know nothing of the sons, but Miss Annie early developed great
taste in water-colour painting; and among her early productions
was a miniature of a near relative of the present writer, done in
1855.&nbsp; Another of Miss H. A. Palmer, eldest daughter of
Captain Moffat Palmer, of Horncastle, and widow of the late
George Storer, Esq., of Thoroton Hall, Notts., late M.P. for S.
Notts., was done about the same time.&nbsp; She afterwards
removed to London, and became the first miniature painter of her
day; was a frequent exhibitor in the Royal Academy, and a
favourite with Queen Victoria and the Royal family, of most of
whom she painted miniatures.&nbsp; She died unmarried Feb 15th,
1901, aged 83, and was buried in the Horncastle cemetery.</p>
<p>Another daughter, Leonora, married a Mr. F. Stapleforth, of
Holbeach.&nbsp; Two other sisters, Fanny and Emily, unmarried,
carried on a ladies&rsquo; school at Spalding; and another,
Charlotte, married a former Under Master of the Horncastle
Grammar School, Rev. W. Hutchinson, who in 1862 was appointed by
the Lord Chancellor Vicar of Howden, in Yorkshire.&nbsp; Of these
Emily, died unmarried, May 28th, 1903, aged 80, and was also
buried in the cemetery; as well as Charlotte (Mrs. Hutchinson),
who died Oct. 19th, in the same year, aged 73.&nbsp; Their graves
are situated to the east of the chapel.</p>
<h3><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>LORD ALLERTON.</h3>
<p>Lord Allerton, formerly Mr. William Lawnes Jackson, is a
member of a Horncastle family.&nbsp; A near relative was a
well-known object, a few years ago, in our streets as a cripple,
going about on a donkey, lying flat on a large saddle or
&ldquo;pad,&rdquo; his only means of locomotion.&nbsp; Lord
Allerton&rsquo;s father, William Jackson, left Horncastle for
Leeds, somewhere in the &ldquo;thirties,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;forties,&rdquo; going it is said, with only half a
sovereign in his pocket, given by an aunt, and a spare shirt
given by an uncle.&nbsp; At Leeds he found employment in the
tanyard of a Mr. Robert Barker, where he presently became
foreman.&nbsp; He afterwards returned to Horncastle and worked in
the tanyard of the late Mr. Hawling; but went back to Leeds and
commenced tanning on his own account, at Meanwood near Leeds, and
afterwards on a still larger scale at Buslingthorpe.&nbsp; He
speedily began to prosper, and in due course was succeeded by his
son; who made a large fortune in the same business.&nbsp; He
became a magistrate of Leeds, and was elected to the Mayoralty in
1895.&nbsp; He represented North Leeds in Parliament for many
years, as a conservative, being first elected in April, 1880, and
re-elected five times, with ever increasing majorities.&nbsp; He
was for many years a Director and Chairman of G.N.R. Company, and
held other public offices.&nbsp; In 1896 he succeeded Mr. A. J.
Balfour, under Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s administration, as Chief
Secretary for Ireland, being also, for several years, Financial
Secretary of the Treasury; and was raised to the peerage in June,
1902.&nbsp; He was born in 1840, married in 1860, Grace, the only
daughter of George Tempest, Esq.&nbsp; He owns, as his country
seat, Allerton Hall, Chapel Allerton, Leeds, and 27, Cadogan
Square, as his town residence.&nbsp; His uncle, Mr. John Green,
still lives in Horncastle, on the Edlington Road.</p>
<h3>EDWARD GILLIAT.</h3>
<p>Edward Gilliat was the eldest son of the late Mr. George
Gilliat, of the Manor House (now called
&ldquo;Banovallum&rdquo;), by his second wife.&nbsp; He was
educated partly at the Grammar School, being afterwards a pupil
of Canon Sanderson, at Seaford, Sussex.&nbsp; He entered at
Pembroke College, Oxford, where he obtained a scholarship in
1861.&nbsp; In 1862 he took a 1st class in Classical Moderations,
and 1st Liter&aelig; Humaniores, 1864.&nbsp; In 1867 he was
<i>Proxime accessit</i> for the Latin essay.&nbsp; He was
appointed Assistant Master at Westminster School, Sept., 1867,
holding the post to Dec., 1870.&nbsp; He was ordained deacon in
1870 and priest in 1871, by the Bishop of London.&nbsp; In Sep.
1871, he was appointed Assistant Master at Harrow, where he
remained till 1900.&nbsp; He has been a voluminous writer,
publishing his first work, <i>Asylum Christi</i>, 3 vols., in
1875; <i>On the Wolds</i>, 1879; <i>Under the Downs</i>, 1882;
<i>Forest Outlaws</i>, 1886; <i>John Standish</i>, 1889; <i>In
Lincoln Green</i>, 1893; <i>Wolf Head</i>, 1898; <i>The
King&rsquo;s Reeve</i>, 1899; <i>Romance of Modern Sieges</i>,
1907; and <i>God save King Alfred</i>, in the same year.&nbsp; He
also published, for the S.P.C.K., <i>Dorothy Dymoke</i>, and
<i>Champion of the Right</i>.&nbsp; He has now retired from
scholastic work and resides at St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hill,
Worcester.</p>
<h3>FREDERICK GROSVENOR.</h3>
<p>We have already in our notice of the Grammar School (p. 98)
given an account of the Rev. Francis Grosvenor, son of an
ironmonger in the town; <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>there was
also another son, Frederick, educated under Dr. J. Bainbridge
Smith, at the school, who graduated at Oxford, and was ordained
deacon in 1860, and priest in 1861.&nbsp; He held a curacy at
Basford, Notts, 1860&ndash;62; was travelling Chaplain to the
Bishop of Brisbane, 1862&ndash;65; Curate of Holy Trinity,
Westminster, 1866&ndash;67; of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Hulme,
Manchester, 1867&ndash;69; of St. Gabriel&rsquo;s, Canning Town,
London, 1869&ndash;73; at Dudley, 1874&ndash;76; and at Hornsea,
near Hull, 1876&ndash;85; when he, like his brother Francis,
retired to Epsom, and succeeded him as Chaplain to the Union
there, until his decease.</p>
<h3>WILLIAM BARTON CAPARN.</h3>
<p>Mr. John Caparn, Chemist, having a shop in the High Street
(now occupied by Mr. Herbert Carlton), had a son, William Barton
Caparn, who graduated at Brazenose College, Oxford, taking
honours, in 1843.&nbsp; He was ordained deacon in 1843, and
priest in 1845, in the diocese of Ripon.&nbsp; He became Vicar of
East and West Torrington, near Wragby, in 1846, which he held
till 1859.&nbsp; He held the benefice, as Vicar, of Drayton,
Somersetshire, from 1866 to 1875.&nbsp; Having private means, he
gave up that benefice, and became Curate of Angersleigh, in the
same county, 1877&ndash;79; which he then gave up, and undertook
the Chaplaincy of the Taunton Union, and local hospital.&nbsp;
These he resigned after a few years, and resided at Taunfield
House, Taunton, until his death, April 10th, 1892.&nbsp; He
published various minor works; the first being a small volume on
<i>Epitaphs</i>, later productions were <i>Meditations to be used
in Church before Divine Service</i>; <i>Councils and warnings
before and after Confirmation</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>George Gilliat, Esq., late of The Wharf, Horncastle, married,
as his first wife, Miss Caparn, a sister.&nbsp; Miss Helen
Caparn, another sister, married Mr. William Sharples, Surgeon, a
partner of the late Mr. T. Snaith, of Horncastle, and one of the
first doctors at Woodhall Spa.&nbsp; Mr. Sharples left Horncastle
for Wisbech, being appointed by the trustees first resident
physician at the hospital founded in that town by Miss Trafford
Southwell.&nbsp; Losing an only daughter while there, the shock
was so great, that he resigned the post, and removed to Taunton,
and took up there the practice of a deceased brother, which he
carried on until his death, Feb. 8th, 1897.&nbsp; At Horncastle
he resided for some years in the old vicarage, south of the
churchyard, afterwards moving to the house next the
&ldquo;Fighting Cocks&rdquo; Inn, called &ldquo;Westholme
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; For some years he was a very popular
Secretary to the Southwold Hunt.</p>
<h3>W. H. BENSON BROWN.</h3>
<p>Among more recent natives of Horncastle, who have
distinguished themselves, is the son of the late Mr. Robert
Brown, of the Market Place.&nbsp; He graduated at University
College, Durham, as Licentiate in Theology, 1887, and was
ordained deacon in 1890, priest in 1891, holding the curacy of
North Ormsby, near Middlesborough; and was appointed Rector of
Bucknall, near Horncastle, in 1898, by the patron his
father-in-law, the late Mr. James Dunham, Merchant, of
Horncastle.&nbsp; He was appointed Inspector of Schools,
1899.&nbsp; Mr. Benson Brown is an energetic worker, has restored
his church, adding a carved reredos of oak, a handsome lectern,
and filling the east window with good stained glass.&nbsp; He has
also introduced various reforms and improvements in the
parish.</p>
<h3><!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>WILLIAM HENEAGE SHARP.</h3>
<p>Another native of Horncastle, who has already done credit to
the town is the son of Mr. Henry Sharp, Saddler, in the Bull
Ring; of a very old firm, established in 1760, and doing an
European business.&nbsp; William Heneage Sharp was educated at
the local Grammar School, 1885&ndash;9, where he gained the first
scholarship granted by the Governors, under the reformed
system.&nbsp; He then went to the college at Framlingham,
Suffolk, 1889&ndash;90, a county institution founded as a
memorial of the late Prince Consort, and there gained several
prizes.&nbsp; He then became a Junior Master in a private school
at Devizes; and during his stay there took the 2nd and 4th prizes
at the College of Preceptors.&nbsp; He next accepted a Mastership
at John Ellis&rsquo;s endowed school in South London (Gospel
Oak).&nbsp; After which he studied at King&rsquo;s College,
London, 1899&ndash;1901, where he gained the Jelf prize for
Dogmatic Theology, the Senior Wordsworth prize for Latin, and the
Barry Divinity Prize.&nbsp; He was also appointed Precentor, and
afterwards Dean, of the college, being senior student of his
year, and taking a first-class in the final examination.&nbsp; He
was ordained by the Bishop of London, in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral, in 1901, being appointed &ldquo;Gospellor&rdquo; on
the occasion.&nbsp; He was Curate of Staines, Middlesex,
1901&ndash;3, removing afterwards to St. John the Evangelist,
Holborn, 1903&ndash;8; and was then appointed Theological Tutor
and Sub-Warden at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, in
the Diocese of Ripon.</p>
<h3>ALFRED H. HEALEY.</h3>
<p>A youth of Horncastle who has distinguished himself, though
chiefly in another line, is Alfred H. Healey, son of the late Mr.
Alfred Healey, Brewer and Merchant, of Horncastle, Branston and
Lincoln.&nbsp; He was appointed to a Mastership of Ardingly
College, Sussex, but removed to Alnwick College more
recently.&nbsp; A member of a family remarkable for their
ability; a brother, though still young, being high up in the
Civil Service; he is specially distinguished as an athlete.&nbsp;
Among his performances are the following:</p>
<p>Olympic Games, at Athens, 1906, 2nd in 110 metres hurdle
race.</p>
<p>English Championship, 120 yards hurdle race, at Manchester,
1907, 2nd.</p>
<p>Northern Counties&rsquo; 100 yards Championship, hurdle race,
Darlington, 1905, 2nd.</p>
<p>Northern Counties&rsquo; Champion, 100 yards, at Batley, 1907,

<p>Northern Counties&rsquo; Champion, 220 yards, at Darlington,
1907, 1st.</p>
<p>Northern Counties&rsquo; Champion, long jump, at Darlington,

<p>A record, no one before having won more than two events.&nbsp;
His &ldquo;bests&rdquo; have been: 100 yards in 10 seconds; 120
yards (hurdles) 16 and three-fifth seconds; 220 yards (hurdles)
23 seconds; high jump, 5-ft. 8-in.; long jump, 22-ft. 4-in.&nbsp;
He was also selected to represent England in the foot races at
the Franco-British Exhibition, at Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush,
1908.</p>
<h3>WILLIAM MARWOOD.</h3>
<p>Horncastle had, for some years, the dubious honour of being
the home of the public hangman.&nbsp; William Marwood was born at
Goulceby, about six miles from Horncastle, and afterwards lived
some years in Old Bolingbroke, coming to Horncastle about 1860;
where he was a shoemaker, having a small shop in Church Street,
now occupied by Mr. Joseph Borrill, of the same trade.&nbsp;
Before being himself appointed hangman he assisted his
predecessor in that office, <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Calcraft,
and succeeded him in 1872; continuing the duties until his death,
Sept. 4th, 1883; when he in turn was succeeded by Bartholomew
Binns.&nbsp; He was rather short in stature, with large square
head and large hands, indicative of firmness of character.&nbsp;
His first official act was to hang a man named Francis Horry, at
Lincoln, who murdered his wife at Boston, in 1872; his last was
to hang a man, James Burton, at Durham, who murdered his young
wife, aged only 18, from jealousy.&nbsp; On this occasion the man
fainted on the scaffold, and got entangled with the rope under
his arm, and Marwood had to lift him in his arms to get him
disentangled, and then drop the unconscious man down&mdash;a
painful scene. <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a>&nbsp; This was only about a fortnight
before his own death.&nbsp; Among his last executions was that of
Charles Peace, a notorious burglar, who shot a man at Banner
Cross, near Sheffield.&nbsp; In May, 1882, he went to Dublin to
execute the perpetrators of the Ph&oelig;nix Park murders, three
Fenians, who shot Lord E. Cavendish, and his secretary, Mr.
Burke.&nbsp; In his last illness, which was short, it was
suspected that his health had been in some way injured through
Fenian agency, and a post mortem examination was held by order of
the Home Secretary, but a verdict was returned of &ldquo;natural
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Henry Sharp, Saddler, of the Bull Ring,
was one of the jury on this occasion.</p>
<p>Marwood&rsquo;s wife was, for some years, ignorant of her
husband&rsquo;s official occupation, as he generally accounted
for his absence by saying that he had to go away to settle some
legal question.&nbsp; Visiting the slaughter-house of a
neighbouring butcher, he observed to him that he could
&ldquo;do&rdquo; for men as the butcher did for cattle, because
the men whom he had to deal with were themselves
&ldquo;beasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of Marwood&rsquo;s official paraphernalia are still
preserved at the Portland Arms Inn, Portland Street, Lincoln,
where he generally stayed at an execution.&nbsp; The late Mr.
Charles Chicken, who resided in Foundry Street, Horncastle, had a
rope 1&frac14;-in. thick, given him by Marwood, with which he had
hanged six or seven criminals.&nbsp; Other ropes used by him are
in Madam Tussaud&rsquo;s exhibition, in Baker Street, London,
where there is also a bust of himself.&nbsp; He used to exhibit
his ropes to foreign horse-dealers, who attended the great August
Fair at Horncastle, at a charge of 6d. each.&nbsp; There was
recently a portrait of Marwood, in crayons, in a barber&rsquo;s
shop, 29, Bridge Street, drawn by J. S. Lill, postman, but this
has now disappeared.&nbsp; Marwood&rsquo;s favourite dog, Nero,
and other effects were sold by auction, after his death in 1883,
by Mr. W. B. Parish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Other Horncastrians whose lives, or circumstances, were more
or less exceptional, may be here also briefly noticed.</p>
<h3>HENRY TURNER.</h3>
<p>Mr. Henry Turner, about the middle of the 19th century, was a
corn and coal merchant, and also land agent for Sir Henry Dymoke,
Bart., of Scrivelsby Court.&nbsp; He occupied the house at the
corner of South Street, next the water side, then a private
residence, but now the shop of Mr. F. Stuchbery,
Ironmonger.&nbsp; He married the widow of Arthur Thistlewood, a
native of Horsington, noted, in his later years, as the leader of
the &ldquo;Cato Street Conspiracy,&rdquo; which <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>proposed to assassinate the ministers of the
government, in London, when attending a dinner at Lord
Harrowby&rsquo;s residence, in February, 1820.&nbsp; The plot was
discovered and frustrated, and Thistlewood, with others of his
guilty confreres, was executed on May 1st in that year.&nbsp;
Mrs. Turner was the daughter of a butcher, named Wilkinson, whose
shop was situated in the High Street, where is now the shop of
Mr. Uriah Spratt.</p>
<h3>MARTIN BROWN.</h3>
<p>Mr. Martin Brown, grandfather of Mr. W. H. Brown, Plumber and
Glazier, of Church Lane, was in the early part of the 19th
century captured by the press gang in Horncastle, and made to
serve in H.M.S. Mars, in the war with Napoleon.&nbsp; In one
contest his ship was lashed to a French man-of-war, to fight it
out, and his captain was killed.&nbsp; He survived to tell the
story till 90 years of age, with scarcely a day&rsquo;s illness,
until his death, Nov. 9th, 1866.&nbsp; He lies buried in Holy
Trinity churchyard, his wife, who predeceased him by several
years, being buried in St. Mary&rsquo;s churchyard, on the
south-east side.</p>
<h3>CAPTAIN SHEPHERD.</h3>
<p>Captain Shepherd, an old naval officer, lived many years, and
died, in Union Street, now called Queen Street.&nbsp; He had had
many voyages and experiences, which he was fond of recounting to
his many friends.&nbsp; He had brought home many trophies and
curiosities; among other things he gave an Indian bow, made of
sugar cane, and poisoned arrows, to the present writer, when a
boy.</p>
<h3>MISS FRANKLIN.</h3>
<p>In the next house to Captain Shepherd resided Miss Franklin,
sister of the great arctic navigator, Sir John Franklin.&nbsp;
Much interest was taken in Horncastle in the fate of Sir John,
when absent on his last polar voyage, and considerable sums were
raised, more than once, among the residents in the town, to
assist Lady Franklin in sending out vessels in search of her
husband, under the command of Captain Leopold MacClintock and
others.&nbsp; We have mentioned elsewhere that a public dinner
was given to Sir John, at the Bull Hotel, just before he sailed
for the last time to the north.</p>
<p>In connection with this it may be added that the son of
another great arctic explorer, Sir John Ross, used to visit
friends in Horncastle, and is still remembered.&nbsp; Sir John
Ross sailed in search of Sir John Franklin in 1848, but was
unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>EDMUND KEANE.</h3>
<p>Edmund Keane, the Tragedian visited Horncastle with his
company, in the first half of the 19th century, and acted in a
large building, which is now the warehouse of Mr. Herbert
Carlton, Chemist.&nbsp; The mother of Mr. Henry Sharp, Saddler,
and the late Mr. Henry Boulton, of St. Mary&rsquo;s Square, among
others, witnessed these performances.&nbsp; In connection with
this, it may be added, that Mr. Charles Keane, Actor, son of the
above, sent two nieces to be educated at a ladies&rsquo; school,
kept by Mrs. Nicholson, Bank Street, Horncastle, and on their
leaving he made her a present of a valuable pianoforte.</p>
<h3><!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>AMBROSE LANGLEY.</h3>
<p>About 30 years ago Robert Langley kept an inn in South Street,
called the &ldquo;Coach and Horses,&rdquo; on the premises now
occupied by Mr. Crowson, Grocer.&nbsp; His son, Ambrose Langley,
became a noted footballer, in Horncastle and neighbourhood.&nbsp;
He afterwards left the town and joined the Grimsby Town Football
Club; subsequently he went to Middlesborough, Yorkshire, playing
for the Ironopolis Football Club.&nbsp; He afterwards joined the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, which team he was with eight
years, being captain three years; playing in the final for the
English Cup, for that team, when they beat Wolverhampton
Wanderers by two goals to one, in 1896.&nbsp; Leaving Sheffield
Wednesday he became manager of the Hull City Football Club, which
position he now (season 1907&ndash;8) holds.</p>
<h3>CAPTAIN SURGEON SMITH.</h3>
<p>Captain Surgeon Smith, son of a draper, Mr. Walker Smith, who
occupied, about 25 years ago, the shop near the Post Office, on
the south side of the High Street, now occupied by Mr. Redmore,
enlisted as a private in the Army Hospital Corps; and,
afterwards, passing all examinations with credit, he rose from
the ranks to become medical officer in the corps; an exceptional
instance of such promotion.</p>
<h3>HENRY ALLENBY.</h3>
<p>Henry Allenby, son of a fellmonger, Mr. Richard Allenby,
residing near the Wong, and having a tanyard on the Lincoln Road,
became an assistant chemist at St. Albans.&nbsp; Afterwards
coming under notice, in a chemist&rsquo;s shop in London, he was
selected to accompany the Duke of Edinburgh in his tour round the
world, in H.M.S. Galatea, as dispenser to the expedition.&nbsp;
This was in 1866; and in this capacity he visited India, Japan,
China, Australia, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>JOHN SCHOFIELD.</h3>
<p>Mr. Robert Schofield, Landlord (in the middle of the last
century) of the Saracen&rsquo;s Head Inn, Bridge Street,
Horncastle, had a son, John, who left Horncastle for London, and
became a member of the Stock Exchange, where, from small
beginnings, he became so successful in business, that he
eventually married a daughter of Bishop Blomfield, of London.</p>
<h3>MISS ROBINSON.</h3>
<p>The Rev. W. Robinson, Vicar of Wood Enderby and Wilkesby, in
the middle of the 19th century, like several other clergy, who at
that time had no country residences, lived in Horncastle.&nbsp;
His daughter, happening to be of the same size and figure as
Queen Victoria, was for several years engaged in the
Queen&rsquo;s service, as a living model, on whom were
&ldquo;tried&rdquo; all dresses intended for the Queen.&nbsp; In
return for this she received, as a perquisite, her
Majesty&rsquo;s cast-off dresses, from the sale of which she
realised an acceptable income.&nbsp; It is said that, through
her, on the marriage of a lady friend, the dresses of both bride
and bridesmaids were all royal attire.&nbsp; It was generally
understood that <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>this appointment was due to the
representations, in her favour, of Miss Annie Dixon, the artist
(herself a native of Horncastle, mentioned elsewhere), who was at
that time a <i>grata persona</i> with the royal family.</p>
<h3>JOHN CUSSONS.</h3>
<p>Mr. John Cussons, son of the late Mr. John Cussons, Baker, in
the Bull Ring, and nephew of the late Mr. David Cussons, Printer
and Bookseller, High Street, Horncastle, ran away before his
apprenticeship had expired, and went to America, settling in the
Confederate States.&nbsp; He there espoused the Confederate cause
against the Federals, and took a leading part in the civil war,
commanding Confederate forces in several important
engagements.&nbsp; Since that time he has visited Horncastle, and
has published a history of his military operations.&nbsp; He now
resides on his own property, at Forest Lodge, Glen Allen,
Virginia.&nbsp; His last publication, in 1908, is <i>Jack
Sterry</i>, <i>the Jessie Scout</i>.&nbsp; He is also the author
of <i>A Glance at Current History</i>, <i>The Passage of the
Thoroughfare Gap</i>, <i>Some Modern Pillars of State</i>,
<i>Principles of Cryptiography</i>, <i>Assimilating the
Indian</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>HENRY ALLISON.</h3>
<p>Henry Allison, son of Mr. Allison, Miller, formerly residing
in West Street, married a daughter of Mr. David Cussons, and
leaving the town about 1848, settled in Hull, where he
established a large business as paper manufacturer.&nbsp; He was
elected Mayor of Hull; and died some years ago, leaving a widow,
who resides in a large mansion, which he built on the outskirts
of the town, Marlborough House, Anlaby Road.&nbsp; The business,
with several branches, is still carried on by members of his
family.</p>
<h3>JOHN BROWN.</h3>
<p>John Brown, the &ldquo;Poet Laureate&rdquo; of Horncastle, has
already been mentioned; he is chiefly known by the volume
<i>Liter&aelig; Laureat&oelig;</i>, published in 1890, dedicated
to Lord Tennyson, by permission, and containing most of his
poetical productions.&nbsp; These are remarkable for his
knowledge of Lincolnshire dialect and local folk-lore.&nbsp; The
volume was published, after his death, on behalf of his
widow.</p>
<p>He was born in the first workhouse, adjoining St. Mary&rsquo;s
churchyard, his parents being in charge of that
institution.&nbsp; Being first apprenticed to a cabinet maker,
Mr. J. Williams, when only just &ldquo;in his teens,&rdquo; he
ran away to Hull, and took service on a vessel, the Margaret,
bound for Cronstadt.&nbsp; His first voyage, however, was
sufficient to disgust him with marine life.&nbsp; When about 15
he found employment with a theatrical scene painter from London,
who settled in Horncastle.&nbsp; He afterwards went to London to
learn his trade as a house decorator.&nbsp; He married in 1833 a
Miss Gainsborough, of Alford.&nbsp; In 1838 he went to Lincoln,
and for some years carried on his trade there.&nbsp; In 1848 he
returned to Horncastle, and still carrying on his trade, became a
member of a literary coterie, who used to hold meetings in the
coffee room of the Bull Hotel.&nbsp; In 1860 he bought a house on
the Louth Road, which he opened as the Globe Inn, and which
became the resort of his literary friends.&nbsp; Literature,
however, did not conduce to business.&nbsp; In 1872 his health
failing, and his savings <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>having
evaporated, he was granted a residence in the Whelpton
Almshouses, where he continued to employ his pen, in comfort,
until his death in 1890. <a name="citation159"></a><a
href="#footnote159" class="citation">[159]</a></p>
<h3>THOMAS BAKER.</h3>
<p>The late Mr. Thomas Baker has already been referred to, but is
worthy of a fuller account.&nbsp; He was not a native of
Horncastle, but lived in the town more than 60 years, and became
so identified with its interests, in many ways, that he may well
be regarded as one of its &ldquo;worthies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Born in
1814, at Braintree, in Essex, he was the son of a veterinary
surgeon in that town, his family having previously there owned
the once well-known coaching house, named The Horn Inn; although
earlier members of his family had occupied a higher position; one
of them, named Thorowgood, having founded the Grammar School at
Oxford.</p>
<p>Before coming to Horncastle, in 1841, Mr. Baker was known on
more than one county cricket ground, and had distinguished
himself on the University ground at Cambridge,
&ldquo;Parker&rsquo;s Piece.&rdquo;&nbsp; On coming to Horncastle
he immediately made his mark in cricket as a round-hand bowler;
and the leading young men of the neighbourhood became his
pupils.&nbsp; One of his feats was, in a match between an 11 of
All England and 22 gentlemen of the county; when he bowled out,
with his first ball, Iddison, Captain of the All England
team.&nbsp; The great matches in which he took part for many
years were too many to tell.&nbsp; Among other things he had the
distinction of being employed by Sir Evelyn Wood to train a
village club in his parish.</p>
<p>Besides his cricketing skill he was remarkable for his
ventriloquial powers; and the story was told, that, while sitting
in conversation with two strangers, at the Bull Hotel, he threw
his voice under the table.&nbsp; The two sprang up to catch the
supposed eavesdropper, when he at once calmed them by throwing
his voice in another direction, and then letting them into the
secret.&nbsp; He was also, in his way, a fair actor; and, with
the late Mr. John Brown, the Horncastle Laureate, and others, he
helped to amuse considerable audiences, in town and
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In comedy he could take all the parts
himself, rapidly changing his dress, and at one moment adopting
the high falsetto tones of an old crone, and the next moment
speaking in the deeper accents of a strong man.&nbsp; It is
greatly to his credit that, only having for many years a small
shop, famed chiefly for his two specialites, &ldquo;bull
eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grantham ginger-bread,&rdquo; he brought
up a large family, who have taken good positions in various parts
of the country.&nbsp; He was a staunch conservative and
churchman.</p>
<p>In his later years he was often visited by strangers, who were
entertained by his fund of anecdote and cricketing
reminiscences.&nbsp; Among these we may name the novelist, Miss
Marie Corelli, who, while staying at Woodhall Spa, sought his
acquaintance, as being one of the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; of the
neighbourhood, and to his delight she gave him her
autograph.&nbsp; Mr. J. J. Hissey, the author of <i>A Driving
Tour in Lincolnshire</i>, also visited him at his house in
Horncastle, and says of him &ldquo;although wearing a shabby
garb, he struck me with his perfect self-possession, and superior
manners. . . .&nbsp; I have met many characters, but Mr. Baker
struck me as being the most remarkable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died Feb.
12th, 1903, aged 88; and in his last illness letters poured in
upon him from old friends and pupils, expressing their sympathy
and their pleasant recollections of his company.</p>
<h3><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>ODDITIES.</h3>
<p>To these &ldquo;worthies&rdquo; of the town we here add two or
three of its &ldquo;oddities.&rdquo;&nbsp; About 1844 Billy
Boulton, who kept an inn in Millstone Street, now called North
Street, named the Tom Cat, was noted for his great strength; for
a wager he dragged a &ldquo;dung cart&rdquo; on the turnpike
road, from Lincoln, to his own yard in Horncastle, a distance of
over 21 miles.&nbsp; It is said, however, that he suffered from
rupture for the rest of his life, as a consequence of the great
and continued exertion involved in this feat.&nbsp; The inn is
now named The Cricketers&rsquo; Arms, but it may be noticed that
the figure of a cat is still engraven on a pane of the front
window.</p>
<p>The same man bought the wife of a man named Rogers, a boatman,
who put her up for auction, standing on a tub, with a halter
round her neck, in the public street; the price paid being
&pound;20.&nbsp; She had a son and daughter by Boulton, who both
lived to be married, but died early.&nbsp; In after years, having
lost her (so called) husband, Boulton, she removed to Lincoln,
and there meeting her former husband, Rogers, she became
reconciled to him, and both again lived together, as man and
wife, until death. <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a></p>
<p>A man, known as Aty Rushton (short for Horatio), who lived in
Horncastle, on the West Ashby Road, about the same period, and
let out horses on hire, being in Lincoln, laid a wager that he
would set off from Lincoln, above hill, just after the moon rose,
and ride to Horncastle, 21 miles, before the moon should rise
there; which would be later, the town being in a hollow, with a
steep hill in the west to hide the moon for some time; while
Lincoln is on a hill, with a view to the west over low county,
where the moon would be seen earlier.&nbsp; He rode a swift
animal of his own. and strained all its powers in the
effort.&nbsp; Unfortunately there was then a toll bar on the
Lincoln road about a mile from Horncastle, where he found the
gate closed, and was delayed two or three minutes before the
keeper could pass him through.&nbsp; He pressed on with all
speed, galloping through the town, shouting in his excitement
&ldquo;Now me! now moon!&rdquo;; but as he dashed into his own
yard, he saw the moon shining in a bucket of water, standing by
the stable door.&nbsp; The delay at the toll-bar had lost him his
wager.</p>
<p>A son of the above, Thomas Rushton, was a great fisherman, and
not always particular where he followed his sport.&nbsp; Walking
in the night to a certain lake in a park, about 6 miles from
Horncastle, he fished it and landed two or three brace of good
trout, and then about eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he
called at the hall, and sold them to the squire for his
breakfast.&nbsp; He used to tell this anecdote to his confidants,
with his well-known chuckle of satisfaction, as a satisfactory
stroke of business.&nbsp; Many other stories of his performances
with &ldquo;the angle&rdquo; could be also related, but this may
suffice.</p>
<p>The following relates not to a native of Horncastle, but to
one whom we may call an &ldquo;intruder,&rdquo; although he was
to play his part (not a very creditable one) in the town.&nbsp;
We avoid, for obvious reasons, giving names and dates.&nbsp;
There had occurred a number of petty thefts, which made, those
who possessed anything of value, uneasy about their treasures,
lest their turn for spoliation might come next.&nbsp; The police
arrangements for the town were still of a very <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>primitive
character, and quite inadequate for due protection of the
householder.&nbsp; The days of the &ldquo;bobby&rdquo; and
&ldquo;peeler&rdquo; were not yet, at least in country districts;
although Sir Robert Peel had done away with the old watchman, and
established the present police system in the metropolis; and some
other of our larger towns had followed suit.&nbsp; But in
Horncastle the constable, by way of setting a thief to catch a
thief, had, it was said, himself in his earlier years been a
great smuggler, while in his age he was a spindle-shanked old
man, whom a boy could knock down.&nbsp; Roused by the insecurity
of property, the authorities decided to import a London
detective, disguised in plain clothes.&nbsp; He came, and for a
while marauders, among whom the secret soon leaked out, carefully
stayed their hands.&nbsp; After a time, however, robberies began
to recur; especially a corner shop near &ldquo;the far
bridge,&rdquo; was the scene of considerable pilfering.&nbsp; The
detective was called in to investigate.&nbsp; He took up the
matter, but did not succeed in making any arrests.</p>
<p>It was noticed by someone that a brass button was missing from
the sort of gamekeeper&rsquo;s velveteen coat which he wore; and,
strange to say, a button of the exact kind was found behind the
counter of the shop where the thefts occurred.&nbsp; No public
action was taken in the matter, but it came to be strongly
suspected that the professional thief-taker had himself been
guilty of thieving.&nbsp; Other suspicious circumstances
occurred, but he was a clever man, and nothing was brought home
against him.&nbsp; It was believed, however, that something of
the truth had become known at head quarters, as his appointment
was a few months later cancelled, and he was not appointed
elsewhere.&nbsp; He continued to reside in Horncastle and, having
no employment, he accepted the post of water bailiff to the local
angling association, which he filled for some time, until he
eventually disappeared from the scene of his labours, which were
thought by not a few to be somewhat &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; in the
unfavourable sense of being at least questionable in their
nature.</p>
<p>He had not left the town very long when it became known that
certain parties had received from him some of the goods which had
disappeared from the grocer&rsquo;s shop, which had been
robbed.&nbsp; Sundry hams were found concealed in a hay loft, and
it was generally believed that the robbery of an inn in the town,
not far from the shop in question, as well as other thefts in the
country around, had been perpetrated by him.</p>
<h3>PUBLICHOUSES</h3>
<p>One of the remarkable features of Horncastle is the number of
its publichouses, and these were far more numerous formerly than
at the present day.&nbsp; This was, of course, mainly due to the
great number of dealers who attended the horse fairs, not only
from all parts of England and Ireland, but from most countries on
the continent; especially the great August fair, which formerly
lasted no less than three weeks.&nbsp; The present facilities for
rapid travel, by rail, and quicker means of communication, which
now enable dealers to hear of horses for sale, and to visit them
in their owners stables, before they are brought to the fair, has
altered all this, and the fairs now last only a few days at the
most.</p>
<p>These publichouses had also generally attached to them large
yards, and extensive stabling (as may still be seen), where the
best horses were shewn and tried, without appearing in the
streets.&nbsp; In consequence of the reduced need for such
accommodation many of these publichouses have disappeared.&nbsp;
Among <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>the names of those which have been
lost, are the Royal Oak, the Peal of Bells, Cock and Breeches,
Chequers, Hammer and Pincers, Dolphin, Pack Horse, Woolpack, Fox
and Goose, Marquis of Granby, Blue Bell, Horseshoes, Axe and
Cleaver, Three Maids&rsquo; Heads, Queen&rsquo;s Head, the
George, and others which are only traditionally remembered. <a
name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a></p>
<p>Several of these were almost contiguous.&nbsp; For instance,
on the west side of the market, on the site of No. 1, now (1908)
occupied by Mr. R. W. Clitherow, formerly stood a good-sized
publichouse, which was destroyed by fire.&nbsp; Being rebuilt, it
became the private residence of Mr. H. Sellwood, Solicitor,
father-in-law of the late Poet Laureate, Lord Tennyson.&nbsp;
Separated from this, northward, by only two houses, was the Black
Horse Inn, still existing, and next to this, on what is now part
of the shop of Messrs. Lunn and Dodson, was the Peal of Bells,
and not more than half-a-dozen yards distant, on the opposite
side of the street, was the very old Saracen&rsquo;s Head, still
existing.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Market Place, next to what is now Mr.
Cammack&rsquo;s cycle depot, was the Queen&rsquo;s Head Inn, now
gone; and at the north-east corner of the Market Place, one door
removed from St. Lawrence Street, was the Nelson Inn, still
existing; while at the south-east corner stood the large George
Inn, no longer existing; and near the churchyard, under the same
roof with the old vicarage, was a much patronized dram shop, kept
by a Mrs. Clayton, long since removed.</p>
<p>Of some of these we are able to give particulars, not without
interest.&nbsp; The Cock and Breeches was kept by Roland Oliver,
a breeches maker, whose daughter migrated to London, and, as Mrs.
Hibbert, kept an inn, the Elephant, in Fenchurch Street,
City.&nbsp; At the Queen&rsquo;s Head were, early last century,
barracks for volunteers or soldiers, with their drill sergeants;
who performed their drill and practiced with &ldquo;Brown
Bess&rdquo; in a chalk pit, on the west side of the Edlington
Road, now disused, but still represented by a deep depression in
the field below the footpath to Thimbleby, and at the back of the
gardens of Mr. Frank Heane, of the Garth House, and other
adjoining residents.</p>
<p>At this same inn, the Queen&rsquo;s Head, some 20 years or
more ago, on removing the bricks of the kitchen floor, the
workmen found a skeleton, probably that of a man who had been
murdered for his money at the August fair, and in connection with
this, it was remembered that a farmer living at Stourton, who
used to frequent this inn, had some years before attended the
fair, but never returned home, nor could enquiring friends find
any trace of him.</p>
<p>The Nelson Hotel, on the same side of the Market Place, was
formerly kept by an old man named Vesey, who was said to have
been, in his earlier years, a great smuggler on the coast, but
coming to Horncastle, he reformed, and was appointed
constable.&nbsp; The sign of this inn is a portrait of the great
hero of Trafalgar and the Nile, originally well painted by the
artist, Northouse, but it has recently been repainted in the
worst style, and almost &ldquo;improved&rdquo; out of
recognition.</p>
<p>The George stood on the sites now occupied by the Post Office,
and the adjoining shop of Messrs. Salter, Shoemakers, the
original archway of the inn yard still remaining between
them.&nbsp; This was formerly one of the principle inns of the
town, equal in size to the Bull and the Red Lion; and from it,
before the railway line was opened to Horncastle, the landlord,
Mr. Hackford, ran a coach, to meet the train at Kirkstead.&nbsp;
An incident, in connection with the <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>George may
here be mentioned, which is not likely to occur again.&nbsp; A
wealthy lady, Miss Heald (who had also a house in London, where
the writer, as a boy, visited her), occupied in those days the
old hall (now demolished) in Edlington Park.&nbsp; She was of the
family of Chancellor Heald, to whose memory there is a marble
tablet, on the north wall of the chancel of St. Mary&rsquo;s
Church.&nbsp; She had a nephew, who was an officer in the
fashionable regiment of the Guards.&nbsp; He became enamoured of
the once famous courtesan, Lola Montez, who had been mistress to
the King of Bavaria, attracted by her beauty, it was said, as she
drove, and he rode, along Rotten Row, the resort of fashion, in
Hyde Park, London.&nbsp; She wished to make the most of the
opportunity to regain a respectable position, and pressed her
attentions of the young officer too persistently.&nbsp; She was a
woman of daring and reckless temperament; and his love and
admiration gradually, on closer acquaintance, gave way to
fear.&nbsp; At length he did all he could to avoid her, which
roused her bitter resentment, and at length he became in daily
terror of her revengeful nature.&nbsp; Coming down from London to
Horncastle, to collect his rents, he put up at the George, and
was there found, by a friend who called upon him, sitting at his
luncheon, but with a brace of pistols lying on the table, fully
expecting that she would follow him, and force him into
matrimony.&nbsp; It is said that she ended her days in an
American prison, after perpetrating a murder in a railway
carriage.</p>

<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Another inn worthy of mention here is the Fighting
Cocks.&nbsp; Here this once fashionable but cruel sport used to
be practised, until it was made illegal by Act of Parliament, in
1849, and it is said to have been clandestinely continued for
some time longer, although a penalty of &pound;5 was
imposed.&nbsp; An old man working on the premises in 1902 could
remember the last fight.&nbsp; The &ldquo;pit&rdquo; was in the
present garden, at the rear of the inn yard.</p>
<p>In the Fighting Cocks yard were formerly the kennels of the
South Wold hounds, and the writer can well remember going
frequently, as a boy, while he attended the Grammar School, to
see them fed, as well as occasionally being mounted by the whips
on one of the horses of the hunt, when, after the hunting season,
they went out for exercise.&nbsp; Mr. &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Musters,
the whilom rival of Byron for the hand of Miss Chaworth, was at
that time Master.</p>
<p>In the yard of this inn there still remain two large scythe
blades affixed to the wall of an outhouse.&nbsp; The history of
these is that they were formerly on the front of the inn, facing
the street, because was annually held, on August 21st, what was
called the Scythe Fair, when the county blacksmiths gathered to
purchase scythes, to supply the Irish, and other reapers, for the
coming harvest.&nbsp; This was discontinued when the machinery
for reaping came into use.</p>
<p>The Three Maids&rsquo; Inn was situated in the High Street, on
part of the site now occupied by the Corn Exchange, and was
demolished when that building was erected.&nbsp; A small inn, on
the east side of North Street, now called the Cricketer&rsquo;s
Arms, was formerly named the Tom Cat, because here was sold the
strong old gin of the well-known distillers, Swagne and Borde,
whose trademark was a cat.&nbsp; Hence gin took its name of
&ldquo;Old Tom.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is still the figure of a cat
engraven on the front window, with the words &ldquo;Unrivalled
Tom&rdquo; beneath it.</p>
<p>Opposite the Bull, the leading hotel in the town, replete with
all modern requirements, stands the King&rsquo;s Head, an old
&ldquo;public,&rdquo; still remarkable for its low thatched roof;
the reason for which is said to be, that by the forms of the will
of a former owner, it was bequeathed to his successor, with the
condition attached, that it should continue to be thatched: a
condition which the advance of civilization may, in a few
years&rsquo; time, make it difficult to fulfil.</p>
<p>And here we may make the concluding remark that 100 years ago
most of the houses in Horncastle were thatched.&nbsp; It is on
record (Overton MS.) that the first slated house in the town was
built for a Mr. Storr, a gardener, in what is now the back
passage from the Bow Bridge to the Wong, near the Baptist
Chapel.&nbsp; This was afterwards occupied (1790&ndash;1800) by
Mrs. L&rsquo;Oste, widow of a former Rector of Langton.&nbsp; The
next house to be slated was that of Mr. Titus Overton, lately the
residence of Mr. John Overton, Grocer.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 165</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>THIMBLEBY.</h3>
<p>This parish is contiguous to Horncastle, but the village and
church are distant about 1&frac14; miles from the town, in a
north-westerly direction.&nbsp; Letters arrive at 8.30 a.m., from
Horncastle, where are the nearest money order and telegraph
office and railway station.</p>
<p>As to the name Thimbleby, given in <i>Domesday Book</i> as
Stimbelbi, it doubtless meant originally the Bye (scotice
&ldquo;Byre&rdquo;), or farmstead, of a thane, or owner, in
pre-Norman times named stimel. <a name="citation165"></a><a
href="#footnote165" class="citation">[165]</a>&nbsp; In the
survey made by the Conqueror, A.D. 1085, there are two mentions
of this parish, (1) It is included among the 1,442 lordships, or
manors, of which King William took possession on his own behalf,
ejecting the previous owners; none of whom, in this instance, are
named.&nbsp; Under him it was occupied by 22 soc-men, or free
tenants, and 18 villeins, or bondsmen, who cultivated 4&frac12;
carucates (540 acres), with 240 acres of meadow.&nbsp; This,
however, did not comprise the whole parish, for (2) another
mention gives Thimbleby among the lands granted by the Conqueror
to Odo, Bishop of Baieux, who was half brother to King William,
on his mother&rsquo;s side, and was created by him Earl of
Kent.&nbsp; His brother was Earl of Moretaine, and his sister
Adeliza was Countess of Albermarle.&nbsp; He had been consecrated
Bishop of Baieux before William&rsquo;s conquest of England, in
1049.&nbsp; He was subsequently made Count Palatine and
Justiciary of England.&nbsp; The old historian, Ordericus
Vitalis, says &ldquo;he was reputed to be the wisest man in
England, and &lsquo;totius Angli&aelig; Vice-comes sub Rege, et .
. . Regi secundus&rsquo;&rdquo;; and this <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>was hardly
an exaggeration, since he was granted by William 76 manors in
Lincolnshire, besides 363 in other counties.&nbsp; But we have
observed in several other instances how insecure was the tenure
of property in those unsettled times, when might was deemed
right, and this ambitious Prelate was no exception.&nbsp; He
aspired to the Papacy, the highest ecclesiastical office in
Christendom, and was about to start for Rome, with the view of
securing it through his wealth, when he was arrested and
imprisoned by his royal kinsman, and his estates confiscated.</p>
<p>The portion of Thimbleby granted to this Odo comprised 250
acres of cultivated land, with 12 acres of meadow and 30 acres of
underwood.&nbsp; This was worked for him by three free tenants
and five bondmen. <a name="citation166a"></a><a
href="#footnote166a" class="citation">[166a]</a>&nbsp; On the
attainder of Odo, this land passed again into the King&rsquo;s
hands, to be bestowed doubtless upon some other favourite
follower.&nbsp; Accordingly we find that, shortly after this, the
powerful Flemish noble, Drogo de Bevere, who had distinguished
himself greatly at the battle of Hastings, along with many other
manors in Lincolnshire, held that of Thimbleby.&nbsp; He was, by
Royal Charter, Lord of all Holderness, and took his title de
Bevere from Beverley, the chief town in that division.&nbsp; As
is also related elsewhere, <a name="citation166b"></a><a
href="#footnote166b" class="citation">[166b]</a> the Conqueror
gave him his niece in marriage; but, being of a violent
temperament, Drogo got rid of her by poison, and then, having
thus incurred the anger of William, he fled the country.&nbsp;
His estates, in turn, were probably confiscated, for we find that
a few years later Stephen, Earl of Ambemarle, <a
name="citation166c"></a><a href="#footnote166c"
class="citation">[166c]</a> had five carucates (<i>i.e.</i> 600
acres) of land between Thimbleby, Langton and Coningsby.</p>
<p>This noble was distinguished for his piety, as well as his
other great qualities.&nbsp; The chronicler describes him as
&ldquo;pr&aelig;clarus comes, et eximius monasteriorum
fundator,&rdquo; an illustrious earl and distinguished founder of
monasteries.&nbsp; Among other such institutions he founded, on
the feast of St. Hilary, A.D. 1139, the Priory of Thornton, in
North Lincolnshire.&nbsp; This Stephen also received the lordship
of Holderness, which had been held by Drogo.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his son William, who was surnamed Crassus, or
&ldquo;The Gross,&rdquo; from his unwieldy frame.&nbsp; His
great-granddaughter, Avelin, succeeding to the property in her
turn, married Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, surnamed Gibbosus, or
humpback.&nbsp; But they had no issue, and so, as the &ldquo;Book
of Meux Abbey&rdquo; says, &ldquo;for want of heirs the Earldom
of Albemarle and the Honour of Holderness were seized (once
again) into the King&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; What became of
the demesne of Thimbleby is not specified; but we find from the
survey, already quoted, that in the same century Walter de Gaunt,
son of Gilbert de Gaunt, <a name="citation166d"></a><a
href="#footnote166d" class="citation">[166d]</a> held Thimbleby
and other neighbouring parishes 24 carucates, or in all 2,880
acres of land.&nbsp; We have traced elsewhere <a
name="citation166e"></a><a href="#footnote166e"
class="citation">[166e]</a> the descent of <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the
Willoughby family from the Gaunts, and about 100 years later
(circa 1213, Survey, as before) William de Willoughby succeeded
to these estates, including the demesne of Thimbleby.&nbsp; He
was ancestor of the present Earl of Ancaster, and Lord Willoughby
de Eresby, who now represents this division in Parliament.&nbsp;
How long the estates, in whole or in part, remained with the
Willoughbys is not clear; but we have evidence of their
connection with Thimbleby nearly 100 years later, in a document
dated 1302, <a name="citation167a"></a><a href="#footnote167a"
class="citation">[167a]</a> concerning a dispute as to lands in
Thimbleby, Langton, Woodhall, and several other parishes, between
John de Bec and Robert Wylgherby, the two families being related;
in which the said Robert surrenders to the said John all property
in dispute, for his lifetime, on condition that, after his
decease, the whole shall revert to the said John Willoughby, and
his heirs, for ever. <a name="citation167b"></a><a
href="#footnote167b" class="citation">[167b]</a></p>
<p>From this time we find other names connected with the
parish.&nbsp; Indeed prior to this, in a charter of Bardney
Abbey, dated &ldquo;at the Chapter of the Convent, on Sunday next
after the Ascension of our Lord&rdquo; (22nd May) 1281; we have
among the witnesses, along with others belonging to Edlington,
Wispington, and Baumber, &ldquo;Master Bartholomew of
Thimbleby,&rdquo; and John Crayck of the same, the former being
probably the Rector. <a name="citation167c"></a><a
href="#footnote167c" class="citation">[167c]</a>&nbsp; This
charter refers to certain lands and tenements, the gift to the
abbey of &ldquo;Walter, son of Gilbert, de Bolingbrog,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> Walter, the son of Gilbert de Gaunt, already
named.&nbsp; In another Bardney charter, dated four years later
(30th Sept., 1285), we find again the same Thimbleby witnesses,
with Alured of Woodhall, and others. <a
name="citation167d"></a><a href="#footnote167d"
class="citation">[167d]</a></p>
<p>Three years later than this, in an official inquiry, held at
Lincoln, as to certain knights&rsquo; fees, which belonged to
Elyas de Rabayn and his wife Matilda (12th Nov., 1288), the
jurors declare that &ldquo;Robert de Rothwell holds in Thymelby
and Horncastre,&rdquo; certain &ldquo;rents of assize, to be paid
at the Feast of St. Michael, the Nativity of the Lord, Easter,
and St. Botulph&rdquo; (June 17), amounting to 12s.</p>
<p>A more interesting record is the following.&nbsp; We may
premise that the Norman noble, St. Quintin (so named from a town
of France, in the department of Aisne, the Augusta Veromanduorum
of the Romans), came over among the followers of William the
Conqueror, and his name appears in the famous &ldquo;Battle
Roll&rdquo; of 1066.&nbsp; A Final Concord, of date A.D. 1293,
states that on the Quindene of the purification of the Blessed
Mary (<i>i.e.</i> the 5th day after), a dispute having arisen
between Herbert de St. Quintin on the one part, and Ascelina de
Waterville and Matilda de Diva on the other part, the two latter
being tenants of 3&frac12; carucates of land (<i>i.e.</i> 420
acres) in Thymeleby; it was settled that the said Ascelina and
Matilda should acknowledge the said land to be the right of
Herbert; and for this Herbert granted them, as his tenants, all
the said lands, except six oxgangs (<i>i.e.</i> 90 acres) which
were occupied in separate parcels, by Baldrick, Hogge, Alfsi,
Godric, Walfric, and others; and for this the said Ascelina and
Matilda gave him, in acknowledgment, 40 marks.</p>
<p>A few years after this date it would appear that the Bishop of
Carlisle exercised a kind of ecclesiastical lordship over this
parish.&nbsp; Thimbleby was in the soke of Horncastle, and Ralph
de Rhodes, the former Lord of the demesne <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>of
Horncastle, with its appurtenances, West Ashby, High Toynton,
&amp;c., had granted these (by charter confirmed by Henry III.,
A.D. 1230) to Walter Mauclerk, Bishop of Carlisle, and his
successors.</p>
<p>Accordingly in an old document of the early 14th century, we
find that John de Halghton, Bishop of Carlisle, gave consent for
William de Foletby to convey certain lands in Thimelby, Langton,
and Horncastle, to the Abbot and Convent of Kirkstead, to provide
two monks, to celebrate daily services for the souls of the
faithful deceased.&nbsp; The witnesses were Richard de Wodehall,
William de Polam (Poolham), and others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dated at
Horncastre, on this day of St. Barnabas, 5 Ed. II., 11 June, A.D.
1312&rdquo; <a name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a>&nbsp; This shows a connection with
the monastery of Kirkstead, to which we shall refer
hereafter.</p>
<p>We next come to a record of special interest, of rather later
date.&nbsp; The family of Thimbleby, Thymelby, Thimoldby,
&amp;c., doubtless took their name from this parish, at a period
lost in hoar antiquity.&nbsp; They acquired in course of time
extensive property in various parts of the county.&nbsp; The
chief branch of the family resided at Irnham Park, near Grantham,
which was acquired (about 1510) by Richard Thimbleby, through his
marriage with the heiress of Godfrey Hilton, whose ancestor, Sir
Geoffrey Hilton, Knight, had obtained it by marriage with the
heiress of the Luterels, a very ancient family, several members
of which were summoned to Parliament as Barons, in the 12th
century.</p>
<p>The earlier members of the Thimbleby family are called,
expressly, Thomas de Thymelby, Nicholas de Thymbylby, and so
forth, shewing their connection with this parish.&nbsp; The
family name of Thimelby still survives in the neighbourhood of
Spilsby.</p>
<p>The first mention of a Thimbleby, as an owner in Thimbleby,
occurs in a Post Mortem Inquisition, held at Holtham (Haltham),
on Friday next after the Feast of St. Matthew (Sept. 21), A.D.
1333; where the jurors say that Nicholas de Thymelby held, with
certain other lands in the neighbourhood, two messuages and four
acres of land in Thymelby, of the Bishop of Carlisle, and that
the said Nicholas died on the Feast of the Purification (Feb.
2nd); and that his son Thomas, aged 19, was heir. <a
name="citation168b"></a><a href="#footnote168b"
class="citation">[168b]</a></p>
<p>Then follow a grant of land and other privileges, by the
Bishop of Carlisle, in Horncastle and Upper Toynton, to Thomas,
son of Nicholas de Thymelby.&nbsp; Thomas presented to the
Benefice of Ruckland in 1381.&nbsp; His son John married Joan,
daughter of Sir Walter Taillebois; whose mother was daughter and
heir of Gilbert Burdon (or Barradon), whose wife was sister and
heir of Gilbert Umfraville, Earl of Angus.&nbsp; Thus the family
kept growing in importance. <a name="citation168c"></a><a
href="#footnote168c" class="citation">[168c]</a></p>
<p>Our last mention of this family, in connection with Thimbleby,
shows a still greater expansion.&nbsp; An Inquisition taken 12th
August, 4 Ed. VI. (1550), after the death of Matthew Thimbleby,
of Polam, Esq., shows that he married Anne, daughter of Sir John
Hussey, and that he was seised of six manors besides that of
Thimelby; also of lands in eight other parishes, with the
advowsons of the churches of Tetforde, Farrafford, Ruckland, and
Somersby. <a name="citation168d"></a><a href="#footnote168d"
class="citation">[168d]</a>&nbsp; His widow married Sir Robert
Savile, Knt.</p>
<p>Soon after the first mention of a Thymelby of Thimbleby, we
find another family of some note connected with this
parish.&nbsp; In an agreement made at <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&ldquo;Langton near Horncaster, 8 August, A.D. 1370,
Peter Skynner of Ely, and Alice his wife, for some consideration
not named, surrender to William de Atherby and his heirs, all
their rights in certain lands and tenements in Woodhall, Langton,
Thymelby, Horncastre, Thornton,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a
name="citation169a"></a><a href="#footnote169a"
class="citation">[169a]</a>&nbsp; These lands had evidently been
held by the said Peter Skynner and his wife.</p>
<p>The Skynners were a family of wealth and position.&nbsp; In
1315 Robert and Richard Skynner held the manor of Pinchbeck, near
Spalding. <a name="citation169b"></a><a href="#footnote169b"
class="citation">[169b]</a>&nbsp; They were also land owners in
Hareby and Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Henry Skynner, by will, dated 29th
May, 1612, leaves to his daughter Judith, all his copyhold in
Harebie, to his brother, Sir Vincent Skynner, Knight, lands in
Hareby and other places, with the advowson of the Benefice.&nbsp;
Sir Vincent Skynner was Lord of the Manor of Thornton Curtis; he
was in 1604 appointed by the crown Keeper of East Kirkby Park, as
part of the Royal manor, or &ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; of
Bolingbroke.&nbsp; His son William married a daughter of Sir
Edward Coke, Knight, and was buried at Thornton Curtis, August
17th, A.D. 1626.</p>
<p>We find mention of another owner of land in Thimbleby, in the
15th century, whose apparent love of pelf would seem to have
tempted him to defraud the king of his dues.&nbsp; A certain
Thomas Knyght, of the City of Lincoln, Esquire, died in the 10th
year of the reign of Henry VII. (A D 1495), seized of lands and
tenements &ldquo;in Thembleby,&rdquo; and other places.&nbsp; At
the Inquisition then held, the jurors found that he had alienated
certain parts of the property, &ldquo;the Royal license therefor
not being obtained, to the prejudice and deception of the lord
the King,&rdquo; and the property passed to his son and heir
William, who took possession, with &ldquo;a like evasion of dues,
to the King&rsquo;s prejudice.&rdquo;&nbsp; What penalty was
imposed is not stated; but it was a somewhat remarkable
coincidence, that, as shewn in another Inquisition made the
following year (A.D. 1496), certain witnesses deposed that on the
20th day of June, A.D. 1476 (<i>i.e.</i> 19 years before his
decease), the said Thomas Knyght, and his servants, about the
middle of the night &ldquo;broke and dug the soil of the parlour
of his house, and found &pound;1,000, and more, of the coinage of
the Treasury . . . there placed and hidden,&rdquo; which as
&ldquo;tresour-trove, by reason of the prerogative of the lord
the King, ought to come to his use, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has
all a very suspicious look, Knyght would not have ordered this
search for the money if he had not himself known of its being
there.&nbsp; It looks like a previous attempt at concealment, in
some way to defraud the revenue, which Knyght himself afterwards
felt was a failure, and that it was safer to exhume the hoard
himself, rather than that public officials should do it.&nbsp;
Altogether it would seem that &ldquo;Thomas Knyght, of the City
of Lincoln, Esquire,&rdquo; was somewhat of a sordid character,
and not a proprietor for Thimbleby to be proud of.</p>
<p>We now proceed to records more ecclesiastical.&nbsp; We have
already noted that, with the consent of the Bishop of Carlisle,
William de Foletby, in the 14th century conveyed lands in
Thimbleby to the Abbot of Kirkstead.&nbsp; This would seem to
imply a previous connection of this parish with that monastery,
to attract the Thimbleby proprietor to it.&nbsp; Accordingly we
find that, among the various properties of the Abbey, granted by
Hugh Brito, its founder (A.D. 1139), and other benefactors, were
90 acres of land in Thimbleby, with the advowson of the
Benefice.&nbsp; In those days there was only a very limited
number <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of resident clergy in the country
parishes, <a name="citation170a"></a><a href="#footnote170a"
class="citation">[170a]</a> the churches being served largely by
the monks of the monasteries.&nbsp; In some cases these were
&ldquo;itinerant clerks,&rdquo; in other cases there was a
&ldquo;grange,&rdquo; or dependency, of the monastery in the
parish, having a &ldquo;cell,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hermitage,&rdquo;
for a priest.</p>
<p>Thimbleby was not among the number of parishes which had a
church before the conquest, as Edlington and several other
neighbouring parishes had; but there is no doubt that a church
was erected here soon after that period, which, like the
neighbouring Woodhall, was connected with Kirkstead, and here, as
at Woodhall, there are traces of a moated enclosure eastward of
the church, which doubtless was the site of the grange.</p>
<p>The Abbot of Kirkstead exercised the powers of a superior lord
here in a somewhat arbitrary fashion; it being complained against
him before Royal Commissioners as early as the reign of Edward
I., that he had erected here &ldquo;furc&oelig;,&rdquo; or a
gallows, on which various criminals had been executed; and that
he had appropriated to himself the assize of bread and beer here,
and at Horncastle. <a name="citation170b"></a><a
href="#footnote170b" class="citation">[170b]</a>&nbsp; But
&ldquo;blessed are the peacemakers,&rdquo; and the abbots, with
wholesome influence, were able, when occasion served, to produce
harmony out of discordant elements; as the following records show
(quoted from Final Concords): &ldquo;In three weeks from the day
of the Nativity of the Blessed Mary, 10 Henry III. (28th Sept.,
A.D. 1226),&rdquo; a dispute arising between Reginald, Rector of
Thymelby, and Peter, son of John, tenant of a certain messuage
and toft in Thymelby.&nbsp; Peter was induced to give up his
claim, in favour of Reginald and his successors; and for this the
said Reginald gave him one mark, in recognition of the
concession.&nbsp; Which agreement was made in the presence of
Henry, Abbot of Kirkstead, who himself gave to the church of
Thymelby all right which he had in rent, which he was wont to
receive; not however without an equivalent, which&mdash;being
wise in his generation&mdash;he was careful to secure; for
Reginald, in return, gave him a certain sum &ldquo;to buy a rent
in another place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worldly wisdom of the same abbot appears again in the
following Concord: On the morrow of St. Michael, 10 Henry III.
(30th Sept. A.D. 1226); a dispute between Sarah, the wife of Alan
de Tymelby, and Henry, Abbot of Kirkstead, about a certain meadow
in Tymelby, was happily settled (it being to the soul&rsquo;s
peril to incur an abbot&rsquo;s anathema!) by the said Sarah
giving up all claim to the meadow in favour of the said Abbot,
and his successors; in recognition of which he gave her one
mark.</p>
<p>A gap now occurs in our history, which can only be filled in,
for a time, by conjecture.&nbsp; On the dissolution of the
monasteries by Henry VIII., the possessions of Kirkstead Abbey
were granted by him to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk; on whose
death without issue, they reverted to the sovereign, and were
re-granted to the Earl of Lincoln, of the Fiennes Clinton family,
subsequently Dukes of Newcastle.&nbsp; The Abbey lands in
Thimbleby are not, so far as we know, specially named in this
grant, and therefore we are unable to say positively whether that
family acquired property in Thimbleby or not; but they had
undoubtedly property in Horncastle and neighbourhood.&nbsp; For
instance the manor of Baumber remained in their hands, and
Baumber Church continued to be the family burial place, until the
3rd Duke of Newcastle, late in the 18th century, sold that estate
to T. Livesey, Esq.</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>A few years later, however, we have official evidence
that the manor and advowson of Thimbleby were vested in the
sovereign.&nbsp; By a deed (a copy of which is in the
Rector&rsquo;s possession) dated 10th April, 7 Edward VI. (A.D.
1553), of the Court of Augmentations, a toft and messuage in
Thimbleby were granted by the King to John Welcome; also
&ldquo;the lordship and manor of Thimblebye, with all its rights,
&amp;c., lately belonging to the monastery of Kirkstead;&rdquo;
also &ldquo;the advowson and right of patronage of the Rectory
and Church of Thymmelbie, aforesaid.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next
reign, of Mary, the benefice was presented, by the Queen herself,
to William Brantinghame, being admitted on her nomination 19th
Sept., 1554. <a name="citation171a"></a><a href="#footnote171a"
class="citation">[171a]</a></p>
<p>A deed of that reign, dated 6th Feb., 1 and 2 Philip and Mary
(1554), grants certain lands belonging to the manor of
Thimblebie, to Anthony Kyme, for 21 years, at 10s. per annum</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Next, in the reign of Elizabeth, a deed dated 9th March, 4
Elizabeth (1562), grants certain tofts and lands to John Porter,
for 21 years, at a rent of 18s. per annum; and finally, by deed
dated June 30th, 1564, Elizabeth in consideration of the sum of
&pound;609 5s. 2d., confirms the above grants and leases to
William Conyers and William Haber, both of the Middle Temple, the
patronage of the Rectory, &ldquo;to be held with the manor of Est
Grenwich, in the countie of Kent, free of all duty or military
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a further hiatus in the parish history, we find another
link in the records.&nbsp; The former property of the Thimblebys,
of Poolham, and elsewhere, had been sold to a member of the
Bolles family, in 1600; and Mr. Weir <a
name="citation171b"></a><a href="#footnote171b"
class="citation">[171b]</a> tells us that in the reign of Charles
II. the manor of Thimbleby belonged to Sir <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Robert
Bolles, of Scampton.&nbsp; From Liber Regis we find that Sir John
Bolles presented to the benefice of Thimbleby in 1697, and
doubtless was Lord of the Manor.&nbsp; This Sir John sold his
property, and according to the antiquarian, Browne Willis
(Ecton&rsquo;s Thesaurus), in the reign of Queen Anne, the
patronage of the benefice belonged to &ldquo;Mr.
Kercheval&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1719 and 1725 John Hockin, Clerk, presented.</p>
<p>In 1720 the manor and advowson were bought by John Hotchkin,
Esq., of Tixover; and a Thimbleby record, preserved with the
registers, shows that the Hotchkins have presented from about
that time till recently.&nbsp; In 1767 (Sept. 10th), Allen
Corrance was admitted on the cession of John Kercheval, by Thomas
Hotchkin, Esq., of Alexton, Co. Leicester.&nbsp; In 1778 William
Holmes, M.A., was admitted to the rectory by John Hotchkin, Esq.,
of South Luffenham, on the death of Allen Corrance.&nbsp; In 1831
(Sept. 21st) Robert Charles Herbert Hotchkin, B.A., was
instituted at the rectory, on the death of William Holmes, on the
nomination of Thomas Hotchkin, Esq., of Tixover.&nbsp; The late
T. J. Stafford Hotchkin, Esq., of Woodhall Manor, sold his
property in Thimbleby and some other parishes in 1872; and the
advowson of this benefice, then in his gift, was subsequently
sold to the father of the present Rector, the Rev. C. A.
Potter.</p>
<p>There is another name on record, connected with Thimbleby,
which we have not yet mentioned.&nbsp; Among a list of the gentry
of Lincolnshire, made on the Royal Herald&rsquo;s Visitation of
the County, in 1634, which is still preserved at the
Heralds&rsquo; office, is the name of &ldquo;Robert Frieston, of
Thimbleby.&rdquo;&nbsp; What position he held, or whether he was
a land owner, in the parish, is not stated, but he ranked with
Thomas Cressy (of a very old family), of Kirkby-on-Bain; the
Dymokes of Scrivelsby, Haltham, and Kime; Heneage of Hainton,
&amp;c. <a name="citation172a"></a><a href="#footnote172a"
class="citation">[172a]</a></p>
<p>There is a smaller manor in this parish called the Hall-garth,
the residence attached to which is a picturesque old thatched
mansion, with an old-time garden, enclosed within high and thick
hedges of yew, trimmed in Dutch fashion.&nbsp; It has also a
large &ldquo;stew,&rdquo; or fish-pond, from which, doubtless, in
Roman Catholic times, the owners drew their supply of carp and
tench, for the numerous fast-days then observed.&nbsp; Old title
deeds show that this was at one time crown property. <a
name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b"
class="citation">[172b]</a>&nbsp; At a later date it was owned by
a family named Boulton, who also held land in Stixwould, where
there is still the slab of a Boulton tomb in the pavement of the
aisle of the church.</p>
<p>A slab, on the south side of Thimbleby Church, bears the
inscription: &ldquo;Here lyeth the body of Michael, the son of
Mr. Michael and Elizabeth Boulton, buried the 7th of Septemr,
1692, &aelig;tatis su&aelig; 7.&nbsp; His mother the 28th of May,
Anno Dom. 1725, &aelig;tat su&aelig; 61.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Register has the following entries, &ldquo;1725, Mrs. Boulton, ye
wife of Mr. Mich. Boulton, buried May 28th.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;1738, Michael Boulton buried May 8th.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
last entry connected with this family is that of &ldquo;Michael,
son of Michael and Mary Boulton,&rdquo; who was baptized in 1726
and buried in 1767.</p>
<p>These were the ancestors of the late Mr. Henry Boulton, of St.
Mary&rsquo;s Square, Horncastle.&nbsp; Michael Boulton, in 1719,
left 40s. a year, from the Hall estate, at Bransby near Stow, for
the education of poor children at Thimbleby; leaving also a
bequest for the poor at Bransby.</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>At the beginning of the 19th century this manor was
held jointly by Richard Elmhirst, Esq., of Usselby, and Mr.
Thomas Kemp, the latter of whom resided at the Old Hall. <a
name="citation173a"></a><a href="#footnote173a"
class="citation">[173a]</a>&nbsp; There is a field at the west
end of the village, now the property of H. N. Coates, Esq.,
traversed by mounds and ditches, which was formerly divided into
three separate plots, belonging to Elmhirst, Kemp, and
Hotchkin.&nbsp; The Kemps were of an old stock.&nbsp; In the
Thimbleby Registers the first mention of them is in 1723, <a
name="citation173b"></a><a href="#footnote173b"
class="citation">[173b]</a> but their name implies a much greater
antiquity.&nbsp; One theory has been that they were a Huguenot
family, who came over to England at the time of the French
massacre of Protestants, on St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s day,
1572.&nbsp; Those refugees, in their enforced poverty, prosecuted
various kinds of useful industries; and the Kemps, it is
suggested, acquired their name from being kempsters, or comb
makers.</p>
<p>But it is probable that the name had a much earlier
origin.&nbsp; Kemp (Saxon Cempa) meant a soldier <a
name="citation173c"></a><a href="#footnote173c"
class="citation">[173c]</a> being connected with the
Norman-French and modern English &ldquo;Champion;&rdquo; and
although we might look back with pride to forefathers who
suffered for their religion, it is pleasanter, if only in
imagination, to regard them as having been a race of doughty
warriors, sufficiently distinguished to win a name by their
deeds. <a name="citation173d"></a><a href="#footnote173d"
class="citation">[173d]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Kemp, in the first half of the 19th century, was a
wealthy bachelor, and added to the Hall-garth estate by the
purchase, from time to time, of adjacent property.&nbsp; He lived
in some style, with two maiden sisters to keep house for
him.&nbsp; By his will the land at Thimbleby passed into the
possession of his great nephew, Robert Edwin Kemp; another
nephew, Samuel Harrison Kemp, inheriting most of the personal
estate.&nbsp; But alas! liveried servants, crests and arms, and
other emblems of wealth have become things of the past; for when
this Robert died the property passed to his son, Thomas Kemp, in
whose hands the patrimony speedily evaporated; and other members
of the family are now dispersed, &ldquo;their places knowing them
no more,&rdquo; save as a lingering memory, which will soon be
gone.</p>
<p>The interesting old hall and the manor were then bought by
Reuben Roberts, Esq., of Linden House, Horncastle, who resides
there in the summer.&nbsp; He also owns other land in the
parish.&nbsp; Other owners are E. Hassard, <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Esq., of
Edlington Park; H. N. Coates, Esq., of Langton Manor; the
trustees of the late Mr. Samuel Goe, and several smaller
proprietors.&nbsp; Mrs. Tebbutt, of Horncastle, a relict of an
old Thimbleby family, whose name appears frequently in the parish
books, is now Lady of the Manor.</p>
<p>Some 200 yards east of the church and on the south side of the
main road is a large field, the property of Mr. Henry N. Coates
of Langton, which is known as &ldquo;The Butts.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
has some fine trees, apparently the remains of an extensive
avenue, which have been more numerous even within living
memory.&nbsp; It has been sometimes called &ldquo;The Park
Close,&rdquo; but the title &ldquo;The Butts&rdquo; is
interesting, as probably indicating that it was formerly the site
on which (in the words of a rhymer, it may be said):</p>
<blockquote><p>England&rsquo;s archers of old,<br />
Village wights true and bold,<br />
Unerring in hand and in eye,<br />
Learned skill in their craft<br />
With yew-bow and shaft,<br />
Wand to splinter, or pierce the bull&rsquo;s-eye.</p>
<p>And while the youth gay,<br />
Rough rivals, essay<br />
To rive and riddle each butt,<br />
Sage sires stand by,<br />
And coy maidens cry,<br />
To welcome the winning shot.</p>
<p>Full many such scene<br />
Has been witnessed, I ween,<br />
In that whilome time-honoured spot,<br />
&rsquo;Neath the wide-spreading shade<br />
Of the green wood glade<br />
Which is still named the &ldquo;Thimbleby Butt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this &ldquo;Butts&rdquo; field rises a spring, which is the
source of a small runnel, called &ldquo;Daubeny&rsquo;s
Beck.&rdquo;&nbsp; This bearing westward, for some distance forms
the boundary between the parishes of Thimbleby and Langton, then
flowing through Woodhall falls into the &ldquo;Monk&rsquo;s
Beck,&rdquo; at Poolham.&nbsp; The name &ldquo;Daubeny&rdquo; is
doubtless a corruption of D&rsquo; Albini.&nbsp; The D&rsquo;
Albinis held the Barony, and built the castle of Belvoir, and had
other large possessions in this county and elsewhere; the name is
not uncommon as a field name, &amp;c.&nbsp; There is a field in
Langton called &ldquo;Daubeny&rsquo;s (<i>i.e.</i> D&rsquo;
Albini&rsquo;s) Walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the grounds of Mr. W. A. Crowder, further to the east, near
the Lincoln &ldquo;Ramper,&rdquo; as the highway is locally
called, there was found, a few years ago, a so-called
&ldquo;Roman&rdquo; tomb, somewhat rudely constructed of blocks
of Spilsby sandstone.&nbsp; Within it was a human skeleton, with
bones of a dog, a sword, and the head of a spear.&nbsp; In
connection with this, we may also mention, that in the Rectory
grounds there is an ancient well, of great depth, lined also with
Spilsby sandstone, and said to be Roman; which in the immediate
proximity of the Cornucastrum, or Roman fort of Banovallum, would
not seem to be at all improbable.</p>
<p>An old parish book of Thimbleby, recently shown to the writer,
proves the care which was taken by the parish officials, before
the present poor law system was established, to secure the
comfort and maintenance of poorer parishioners.</p>
<p>At a parish meeting, Nov. 1st, 1819, Thomas Kemp,
Churchwarden, in the chair, it was ordered that John
Sharp&rsquo;s daughter was to have a gown and pettycoat, worsted
for two pairs of stockings, and one blue apron.&nbsp; Four boys
<!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>were to have two smocks each, and eight old people a
strike of coals each per week.&nbsp; At another meeting Margaret
Day was to have worsted for two pairs of socks for her two boys,
herself to spin it; and one pair of shoes for her daughter.&nbsp;
Robert Kemp, and his son Richard, in order to find them work were
to be paid 2s. per day, to &ldquo;gether&rdquo; stones for the
parish.</p>
<p>Again, Maria Day&rsquo;s shoes were to be mended; Mary Atkin
to have a pair of blankets, and her chamber window put in and
thatched.&nbsp; Benj. Benton one pair of shoes, Willm. Adkin a
waistcoat.&nbsp; Mary King&rsquo;s family four shirts, two pairs
of shoes, three frocks, three petticoats, and three dabs
(<i>i.e.</i> pinafores).&nbsp; A pair of breeches for George
Skipworth; Willm. Skipworth to have a spade.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Thos. Kemp was &ldquo;to be allowed &pound;20 for
the use of the poor-house, to be insured for &pound;200 by the
parish, and, when given up to be left in the same
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a meeting on 7th August, 1820, Robert Dixon in the chair,
it was ordered that all paupers receiving assistance should
regularly attend Divine Service, and on their non-attendance the
assistance should be stopped.&nbsp; Mary Todd was to receive her
money (which had been stopped) having given satisfaction to the
vestry for not attending the church.&nbsp; Mary Hobbins&rsquo;
boy to be put to school.&nbsp; &ldquo;To get the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer, and the &lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; put in the church at the
parish expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a meeting held 27th August, 1830, Thomas Kemp in the chair,
it was agreed that &pound;75 be borrowed of Mr. Thos. Kemp, to
pay Mrs. Farmer&rsquo;s expenses to America, to be repaid by the
parish, 30s. weekly, with legal interest.&nbsp; Church rates are
now among the &ldquo;has beens,&rdquo; but in 1843 a rate was
passed of &ldquo;1d. in the pound for the support of the church,
and 10d. in the pound for the highway repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the churchyard, along the south side of the church, are a
group of gravestones of the Kemp family.&nbsp; Eastward are
several of the Marshall family, formerly numerous here, and in
the neighbourhood, holding a respectable position, but now
extinct. <a name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a>&nbsp; There are also a number of tombs
of the Todd family, respectable small farmers, resident in the
parish, from the first notice of a burial, June 24th, 1738, down
to recent years.&nbsp; The Tebbuts and Dixons were also resident,
as tenants or small owners, for many years.</p>
<p>Among the marriage registers, which date from 1695, is the
following note: &ldquo;March 23, 1779, a marriage was attempted
to be solemnized; but the intended bridegroom, to the great
surprise of the congregation assembled, remaining away, the
ceremony, &amp;c. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; The rest is illegible.</p>
<p>We have now to speak of the church.&nbsp; The present edifice
stands on the site of a former 14th century church, which,
judging by the remains that have been found, must have been of
much larger dimensions, and consisted of nave, two aisles,
chancel, and bell tower; the total breadth having been
52-ft.&nbsp; Several fragments of stained glass have, at various
times, been found in digging graves, showing that this early
church, like several others in the neighbourhood, had good
coloured windows.&nbsp; This was taken down in 1744, and from the
materials remaining a small fabric was erected in its place,
consisting of nave and apsed chancel, with no pretensions
whatever to architectural beauty.&nbsp; This (as has been
generally the case with badly constructed edifices of that
period) became also, in turn, so decayed that the present Rector,
on entering <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>on the benefice, decided to rebuild
the church once more; and in 1879 the present structure was
completed at a cost of over &pound;1,000, in the best early
Decorated style.</p>
<p>It consists of nave, chancel, organ chamber on the south, and
an octagonal bell turret, designed by the late Mr. James Fowler,
the Architect, and containing one small modern bell, graven with
the date and initials of W. Carey, Churchwarden in 1744, <a
name="citation176a"></a><a href="#footnote176a"
class="citation">[176a]</a> who demolished the old church.&nbsp;
The nave has three two-light windows, of the decorated style, in
the north and south walls; there is a square-headed two-light
window in the organ chamber; the chancel has a single-light
window in the north and south walls, with a good east window of
three lights, trefoiled, and with a triangle of trefoils
above.&nbsp; In the north wall is a credence recess, and in the
south wall are two stone sedilia.&nbsp; The tiles within the
chancel rails are copied from ancient tiles, which were found
some years ago, at Revesby Abbey.&nbsp; In the west front, over
the door, is a large two-light window, and above it a clock, the
only village church clock in the neighbourhood, by Smith of
Derby.&nbsp; Within the west doorway, let into the north wall of
the tower basement, is a fragment of an old battlement, having a
shield in the centre, probably a relic from the original
church.&nbsp; The font is modern, having a plain octagonal bowl,
shaft, and pediment.&nbsp; The roof is of pitch pine, the timbers
being supported by plain corbels.&nbsp; The lectern, chancel
stalls, and communion table are of good modern oak</p>
<p>Used as a stile in the south fence of the churchyard is a
large slab, on which, above ground, is the matrix of a former
brass, representing one figure, with a broad transverse bar for
an inscription, and connecting it with other figures, which are
now below the ground. <a name="citation176b"></a><a
href="#footnote176b" class="citation">[176b]</a></p>
<p>The church plate includes an interesting paten, presented to
the church in 1837, by the mother of the late Rector, but bearing
hall-marks of 1727&ndash;8, with the letter M and a five-pointed
star below.&nbsp; The chalice is still more interesting, as it
bears an old Lincoln hall-mark, of date about 1570; there are
only eight other known examples of this period in the county.</p>
<p>The rectory is a commodious house, built in 1839, doubtless on
the site of the former monastic grange; it stands in an extensive
garden, embowered among trees of goodly growth.&nbsp; A fine oil
painting at the present time adorns the entrance hall.&nbsp; It
is reputed to be by Spagnoletto, and was formerly in the
monastery of St. Jerome, in Lisbon.&nbsp; Its size is 5-ft. by
4-ft., the subject being St. Jerome translating the Vulgate
scriptures.</p>
<h3>WEST ASHBY.</h3>
<p>This parish, like High Toynton, Mareham-on-the-Hill and Wood
Enderby, was formerly a hamlet of Horncastle, of which it adjoins
the northern boundary.&nbsp; We find them all coupled together in
an extract from the Testa de Nevill <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>[folio 348
(556), quoted <i>Lincs. Notes &amp; Queries</i>, vol. iii, p.
215] as follows: &ldquo;The church of Horncastre, and of Askeby,
and of Upper Thinton, and of Meringes, and of Hinderby, are of
the gift of the Lord,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the Lord of the
Manor.&nbsp; In <i>Domesday Book</i> it is called Aschebi.&nbsp;
Queen Editha, wife of Edward the Confessor, who owned various
lands in this neighbourhood, was Lady of this Manor, as well as
that of Horncastle.&nbsp; She held here six carucates of land (or
about 720 acres), besides which there were 45 soc-men, 5
villeins, and 13 bordars, with eight carucates (or about 960
acres), and 500 acres of meadow and pasture.&nbsp;
(<i>Domesday</i>, &ldquo;Soke of Horncastle.&rdquo;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p><i>Domesday</i> also mentions that the Saxon thane,
Chetelburn, who had property in Coningsby, Keal, Candlesby,
Friskney, and other places in the county, had at Ashby &ldquo;a
mill worth 12s. yearly,&rdquo; a very considerable sum in those
days.&nbsp; The manor was afterwards held by the Conqueror
himself (<i>Domesday</i>, &ldquo;Property of the King&rdquo;);
and it would seem, although there is no direct evidence of it,
that he bestowed the manor on one of his chief favourites,
Ranulph de Paganall, who received from his sovereign extensive
grants in the counties of Somerset, Devon, York, Northampton, and
Lincoln, <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a> including all the lands formerly held
by the Saxon Merleswain, in this county and elsewhere.&nbsp;
Ranulph Paganall founded (A.D. 1089) the Priory of the Holy
Trinity in York, said to have been built on the site of a former
Roman heathen temple; one of his family, Helias Pagnall, being
subsequently Prior of this institution, and Canon of Selby.&nbsp;
When the present Church of the Holy <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Trinity was
restored in 1904, among other ancient monuments, was found the
slab of the tomb of Ralph Ranulph, which is still preserved in
the church, along with sculptures commemorative of St. Benedict,
St. Martin of Tours, Prior Helias, and others. <a
name="citation178a"></a><a href="#footnote178a"
class="citation">[178a]</a></p>
<p>Ranulph, by charter of that date, endowed the abbey with
two-thirds of the tithes of Ashby; which was further confirmed by
charters of 1100, 1125, and 1179.&nbsp; This Ranulph Paganall was
Sheriff of Yorkshire.&nbsp; The last known representative of his
family was William Paganall, summoned to Parliament as a Baron in
the reign of Edward III.&nbsp; Dugdale states <a
name="citation178b"></a><a href="#footnote178b"
class="citation">[178b]</a> that the Priory of the Holy Trinity
was made, by its founder, a dependency or cell of the greater
monastery (marmonstier) of the above, St. Martin in Touraine; and
by the Inquisition, taken at York, 34 Ed. I., it was found that
he claimed no portion of the temporalities of the Priory, beyond
the right to place an official there, during the vacancy of the
priorate, as temporary custodian.&nbsp; The name Paganall became
in later times softened into Paynell; they were at one time Lords
of Bampton.</p>
<p>At a later period the manor of Ashby, probably with that of
Horncastle, belonged to Gerard de Rhodes and his descendant,
Ralph; since in a Charter Roll of 14 Henry III. (pt. i, M. 12),
we find that King&rsquo;s confirmation of a grant, made by the
said Ralph, to Walter, Bishop of Carlisle, of &ldquo;the manor of
Horncastle, with the soke, and the advowsons of the churches, and
all other things pertaining to the same in all places,&rdquo;
evidently including the churches of the hamlets as well as that
of the town.&nbsp; Among the witnesses to this are Gervase,
Archdeacon of Carlisle; and Henry de Capella; the latter name
being noticeable because, as will be seen below, Ashby was called
&ldquo;Capella.&rdquo; <a name="citation178c"></a><a
href="#footnote178c" class="citation">[178c]</a></p>
<p>The Abbey of Kirkstead had a grange in Ashby, which after the
dissolution of the monasteries, was granted in the 5th year of
Edward VI., to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, Lord High Treasurer
of England; this is now part of the Ashby Thorpe estate. <a
name="citation178d"></a><a href="#footnote178d"
class="citation">[178d]</a>&nbsp; In 1820 this was the property
of Mr. Joseph Rinder.&nbsp; It is now partly owned by the Booth
family, and partly by the Smedley trustees.</p>
<p>The parish is still divided into Far Thorpe, Church Thorpe,
and Middle Thorpe.&nbsp; Far Thorpe included the farms held by
the late Mr. Griffin and Mr. Addison.&nbsp; Mr. Wattam&rsquo;s
house, which is moated, was the old Midthorpe Hall.&nbsp; As
being a hamlet of Horncastle, the benefice was formerly called
Ashby &ldquo;Capella,&rdquo; or the Ashby Chapelry; and like
Horncastle, Wood Enderby, High Toynton, and Mareham is given in
&ldquo;Liber Regis&rdquo; as in the patronage of the Bishop of
Carlisle.&nbsp; Until recently it was a perpetual curacy, in
value about &pound;50 a year; but about 30 years ago, on the
enfranchisement of certain episcopal lands, the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners endowed it to the extent of &pound;300 a year, and
built a substantial vicarage.&nbsp; The patronage is now with the
Lord Chancellor by exchange with Kirk Oswald, Cumberland.</p>
<p>The church, All Saints, is of considerable size, being one of
the largest village churches in the neighbourhood, mainly in the
Perpendicular style, and substantially built, consisting of
tower, nave, and chancel, the two latter of the same elevation
throughout.&nbsp; The tower has three old bells, and a peal of
eight tubular bells.&nbsp; Gervase Holles gives the inscriptions
on the bells as being:</p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>1.&nbsp; Sit nomen Domini benedictum.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Intonat e c&aelig;lis vox campana Michaelis.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Sum rosa pulsata Mundi Maria vocata.</p>
<p>One of these was, some years ago, re-cast; and now bears the
inscription &ldquo;voco ad templum, date 1759.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The main features of the church are as follows: the porch arch
is semi-circular, Norman, the west window in the tower is
unusually high, 12-ft. by 4-ft. in width, of three lights.&nbsp;
The north aisle has four bays.&nbsp; The nave, in the south wall,
has two three-light windows, the western one perpendicular and
having pointed arch, the eastern square headed.&nbsp; In the
north wall there is a three-light debased decorated window.&nbsp;
In the west wall of the north aisle is a two-light window of
coloured glass, in memory of Augustus Elmhirst; and in its
eastern wall is a three-light memorial window to his sister, Mrs.
Elizabeth Jane Ruck Keene.&nbsp; In the south wall of the chancel
are two late four-centre two-light windows; and in the north wall
a three-light flamboyant window.&nbsp; Gervase Holles mentions a
north chancel window having &ldquo;sa. a crosse between 4
cinquefoyles arg. . . .,&rdquo; <a name="citation179"></a><a
href="#footnote179" class="citation">[179]</a> but this has
disappeared.&nbsp; The east window is modern, with three
lights.&nbsp; A new window was erected, in 1907, in the north
aisle (corresponding to a window inserted in 1905, in memory of
General and Mrs. Elmhirst), by Mr. H. R. Elmhirst, to the memory
of his late wife, Lilian Frances, nee Hatfeild; the artists were
Powell and Sons; the subject Faith, Hope and Love represented by
three figures.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The communion table has a very handsome cover, with red
frontal, elaborately embroidered with old Roman work.&nbsp; A
carved wooden reredos has recently been presented by Col. and
Mrs. Stack.&nbsp; On a tablet on the north wall <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>is
an elaborate inscription, in memory of Lieutenant Richard
Calthrop, who was killed at the siege of Algiers; erected by his
mother and 10 surviving brothers and sisters; who are said to
have lived to the remarkable average age of 85 years.&nbsp; There
are various tablets commemorative of the families of Rockliffe,
Drewry, Pierce and Elmhirst.&nbsp; There is a north door, as well
as south, to the nave.&nbsp; The font is a plain octagonal one,
perpendicular in style.</p>
<p>The church was restored and reseated in 1873; the tower being
renovated in memory of Mrs. Barnard, otherwise known as
&ldquo;Claribel,&rdquo; a well-known musical composer, connected
with the Elmhirst family.&nbsp; It is lofty and massive,
surmounted by four high pinnacles and large gurgoyles at the
angles.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1561. <a name="citation180a"></a><a
href="#footnote180a" class="citation">[180a]</a>&nbsp; The
communion plate consists of a cup, with inscription &ldquo;Ashby
Chappell, 1758;&rdquo; a paten presented by &ldquo;Elizabeth
Pierce, Christmas Day, 1841,&rdquo; and flagon, given by the
same, in 1859.&nbsp; She was the wife of the Vicar of that day,
the Rev. W. M. Pierce, and an authoress.&nbsp; In the churchyard
are the tombstones of John Thistlewood and his wife; he was
brother of the Cato Street conspirator, and died at Louth, having
formerly resided at Ashby and Wispington.</p>
<p>The late William Elmhirst, Esq., bought the lands here
formerly belonging to the Bishops of Carlisle, and erected a
handsome and substantial residence, in well-wooded grounds; which
in later years passed by purchase to the Booth family, by whom
it, and the estates attached, are now owned.&nbsp; It is at
present occupied by Dr. and Mrs. Newstead.&nbsp; The Elmhirsts
are at present represented by H. R. Elmhirst, Esq., son of the
late General Charles Elmhirst, C.B., who resides at The
Grove.</p>
<h3>HIGH TOYNTON.</h3>
<p>High Toynton is situated about 1&frac12; miles from
Horncastle, in an easterly direction, on the road to Partney and
Spilsby.&nbsp; It would seem to have been formerly, like West
Ashby, an appendage to the Manor of Horncastle.&nbsp; The old
record <a name="citation180b"></a><a href="#footnote180b"
class="citation">[180b]</a> says (as already quoted under West
Ashby) &ldquo;The church of Horncastre, and of Askeby, and of
Upper Thinton, and of Maringes (Mareham), and of Hinderby, are of
the gift of the lord,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the Lord of the
Manor.&nbsp; As thus not being a separate manor, it is barely
more than mentioned in <i>Domesday Book</i>, where it is called
Todintune, and Tedingtone.&nbsp; Queen Editha, wife of Edward the
Confessor, would be Lady of the Manor; but William the Conqueror
took possession and held lands here, in demesne, with tenants and
dependants.</p>
<p>That the manor afterwards, along with that of Horncastle,
became the property of Gerard de Rhodes, is shewn by the
following peculiar circumstances.&nbsp; In a Feet of Fines, at
Lincoln, 9 Henry III., No. 52, it is recorded that an agreement
was arranged in the King&rsquo;s Court at Westminster, (3 Feb.,
A.D. 1224&ndash;5), between Henry del Ortiay and Sabina his wife,
plaintiffs, and Ralph de Rhodes, a descendant of Gerard,
defendant, whereby certain lands in Upper Tynton, Mareham, and
other places, were recognized by the plaintiffs as the property
of Ralph de Rhodes; they receiving, in lieu thereof, 100&frac12;
acres of land, and 11 acres of meadow, with appurtenances, all in
Upper Tynton.&nbsp; These lands are further specified by name, as
24 acres next Graham (<i>i.e.</i> <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Greetham),
12 acres in culture called &ldquo;Hethoten acre&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i> Heath of ten acres), 9 acres of land in
&ldquo;Pesewang&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Peas-field), 5&frac12; acres
in &ldquo;Sex acre,&rdquo; 7 acres in Leir-mewang (or low
mead-field), 4 acres in culture of Lange landes, 6 acres in
Whetewang (<i>i.e.</i> wheat-field), and 10 acres in Kruncewang
(<i>qy.</i> crown&rsquo;s-field?); and further plots not
specially named.&nbsp; The peculiar feature however of their
tenure was, that they and their heirs were &ldquo;to have and to
hold the said lands for ever . . . rendering therefor by the year
one pair of gilt spurs, or 6d., at Easter, for all service and
exaction.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>A Pipe Roll (14 Henry III., Lincoln) states that
&ldquo;Walter, Bishop of Carlisle, holds certain lands
hereditarily of the aforesaid Ralph de Rhodes;&rdquo; and in a
Chancery Inquisition post mortem, 34 Edward III., 2nd Nrs., No.
29 (1360), mention is made of &ldquo;Thomas, son of Nicholas de
Thymelby, and John his younger brother, and their heirs,&rdquo;
as tenants of the Manor of Horncastle, &ldquo;and of lands in
Over Tynton,&rdquo; which they &ldquo;hold of the said
Bishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were scions of the wealthy family of
the Thimblebyies, Lords of Poolham, and other estates.&nbsp; One
of them married a daughter and co-heir of Sir William Fflete,
Knt.; another married a daughter of Sir Walter Tailboys; this Sir
Walter being the son of Henry Tailboys and his wife, Alianora,
daughter and heir of Gilbert Burdon and his wife, Elizabeth,
sister and heir of Gilbert Umfraville, Earl of Angus.</p>
<p><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>By a Close Roll, 20 Henry VII. (part 2 [No. 367] No.
33), it appears that Sir Thomas Dymmok, Knight, had recently
purchased lands in Over Tynton, Nether Tynton, Maring next
Horncastle, and other parishes; which he granted to his son Leo,
and his heirs for ever.</p>
<p>Further, by a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, 24 Henry VII.,
No. 61, it is found that Humphrey Conyngesby, Sergeant at Law,
and others instituted a suit on behalf of William Stavely, and
others, by which he recovered to them the Manor of (apparently
Upper) Taunton, the advowson of the church of Nether Taunton,
about 2,700 acres of various land, and the rent of 4&frac12;
quarters of salt in Over Taunton, Nether Taunton, Tetford, and
other parishes.</p>
<p>The Manor, with that of Horncastle, continued for a long
period in the hands of the Bishops of Carlisle; who were patrons
of the benefice until the creation of a bishopric of Manchester,
in 1848, when their patronage in this neighbourhood was
transferred to that See.&nbsp; The Manor, however, with that of
Horncastle, had previously passed to Sir Joseph Banks, and came
eventually to his successors, the Stanhopes.&nbsp; The benefice,
until late years, was a very poor one, being a perpetual curacy,
annexed to Mareham-on-the-Hill; their joint annual value being
&pound;160, without a residence.&nbsp; But when the episcopal
property (the Bishop being Rector) was transferred to the
Ecclesiastical Commissioners, they, with the aid of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s Bounty, raised the joint benefices to &pound;300 a
year; and in 1869 erected a good residence at Toynton, now
occupied by the Vicar, the Rev. W. Shaw.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, was formerly a
very mean structure, dating from the 18th century (1772), in the
worst of styles, with wooden-framed windows, of large square
panes of glass, and having a flat whitewashed ceiling.&nbsp; The
timbers of this had become so decayed that a former
curate-in-charge, mounting to the false roof, to examine them,
fell through, among the square pews below.&nbsp; This incident
led, not too soon, to the rebuilding of the fabric, at a cost of
more than &pound;1,200 in 1872, on the site of the previous
building, as also of an original 13th century edifice.&nbsp; The
present church is a substantial and neat structure in the early
English style, thoroughly well kept, and with several pleasing
features.&nbsp; It consists of nave, chancel, and porch, with
tower and low spire.&nbsp; The nave has, in the north wall, two
single-light narrow pointed windows, and at its eastern end a
two-light window, having a quatrefoil above.&nbsp; In the south
wall there is one single-light and one two-light window,
corresponding to the above; the porch, taking place of a window
at its western end.</p>
<p>The two-light window in the north wall has coloured glass,
with various devices, one being a small copy of the famous
Descent from the Cross, by Rubens, in Antwerp Cathedral; another
the Royal Arms, with the initials V.R. below, and date
1848.&nbsp; The corresponding two-light window in the south wall
has coloured glass &ldquo;In memory of Eliza, wife of the Rev. T.
Snead Hughes, late Vicar, she died March 9, 1872, aged
57.&rdquo;&nbsp; The subjects in the two lights are the Ascension
of our Lord, and the three women at the sepulchre, with an angel
pointing upward.&nbsp; In the west wall of the nave are two
pointed windows beneath a cusped circlet, all filled with
coloured glass; the lower subjects being John the Baptist
preaching in the wilderness, and the baptism of our Lord by John
in the Jordan; the upper subject is the angel appearing to
Zachariah; all three having reference to the patron saint of the
church.&nbsp; An inscription states that these are a memorial to
the late Mark Harrison and his wife Ann, erected by their
family.</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>The font is of stone, octagonal, having four different
kinds of crosses on the alternate faces, a circular shaft ending
in octagon, and on octagonal pediment.&nbsp; Within the south
porch, over the outer and inner doorways are old fragments of
massive zigzag pattern, all that remains of a whilom Norman
structure.&nbsp; The modern doorway arch, externally, has a
dog-tooth moulding, with floriated finials.&nbsp; The tower, over
the porch, is square below, octagonal above, with small lancet
windows in each face, and is surmounted by a low spire; it
contains one bell.&nbsp; The roof and sittings are of
pitchpine.</p>
<p>The chancel arch is of massive stone, plain, and of wide
span.&nbsp; In the east wall of the chancel are three narrow
windows, the central higher than the other two; they have good
coloured glass by Clayton and Bell.&nbsp; Beneath is a handsome
reredos of Caen stone, erected in memory of the late Mr. Thomas
Terrot Taylor.&nbsp; It has one large central device, the Agnus
Dei within a circle, and on each side four divisions, containing
a dove with olive leaf, Fleur de Lys, ears of corn, a passion
flower, vine leaves and grapes, a crown, a rose, and a
conventional flower.&nbsp; On each side are memorial tablets of
the Ball family.&nbsp; In the south wall is a brass tablet in
memory of Mr. Taylor, and a small pointed window.&nbsp; In the
north wall is a doorway leading to the vestry.&nbsp; Within the
vestry, lighted by a similar small pointed window, are three more
Ball tablets, and a priest&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; In the centre of
the nave floor, close to the chancel step, is a large slab
&ldquo;In memory of the Rev. William Robinson, 22 years
Incumbent, who died May 8, 1830, aged 56.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
register only dates from 1715, and contains no entries of special
interest.</p>
<p>In a List of Institutions to Benefices, preserved at Lincoln,
it is shewn that in 1562, on the resignation of the then Vicar,
one John Howsone, Michael West, Clerk, was appointed to this
vicarage, along with that of Nether Toynton, by Richard Bertie,
Esq., the ancestor of the present Earl of Ancaster.&nbsp; This
was probably by some private arrangement with the Bishop of
Carlisle, as the Berties (as the Willoughbys are now) were
patrons of Low Toynton, but not of Upper, or High, Toynton.&nbsp;
He was instituted to the two benefices on July 9th of that
year.</p>
<h3>MAREHAM-ON-THE-HILL.</h3>
<p>Of this parish, ecclesiastically annexed to High Toynton,
little can be said.&nbsp; The name was anciently written
Maringes, <a name="citation183a"></a><a href="#footnote183a"
class="citation">[183a]</a> or Marun <a
name="citation183b"></a><a href="#footnote183b"
class="citation">[183b]</a>; the former probably from the low
&ldquo;marish,&rdquo; or marsh, &ldquo;ings,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
meadows, the suffix being the Saxon &ldquo;ham,&rdquo; a
homestead.&nbsp; It lies about two miles south-east from
Horncastle, connected with High Toynton by footpath, and bridle
road, across the fields barely a mile in length, but for
carriages a detour of more than double that distance has to be
made.</p>
<p>This parish, like High Toynton and West Ashby, is in the soke
of Horncastle.&nbsp; In <i>Domesday Book</i> it is stated that
the manor comprised 3 carucates, or about 360 acres of land, with
21 soc-men and 11 bordars, <a name="citation183c"></a><a
href="#footnote183c" class="citation">[183c]</a> who had four
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>carucates, or about 480 acres; there were further 60
acres of meadow, and, what no longer exists, 300 acres of
underwood; which was a very large proportion, considering that in
Scrivelsby, now a well wooded estate, closely adjoining, there
were at that time only six acres of underwood.</p>
<p>Sir Lionel Dymoke, a scion of the Scrivelsby family, once
resided in this parish.&nbsp; His will, dated 15th April, 1512,
is a good specimen of the orthography of the period.&nbsp; The
following are portions of it: &ldquo;I leon Dymoke of maryng of

Soules xs,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; On 17th August, 1519
(when he was apparently on his death bed), witnesses certify that
he added a codicil to be annexed, &ldquo;saying these words in
his mother tongue.&nbsp; I will that Sr John Heron knyght have my

<p>As to the owners of the demesne nothing further is told us;
but since in Testa de Nevill, already quoted, it is stated that
&ldquo;the churches of Horncastre, Askeby, Upper Thinton,
Maringes, &amp;c., are of the gift of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Gerard de Rhodes was, doubtless, at one time, the common Lord of
all those manors, as well as his descendant Ralph de
Rhodes.&nbsp; Mr. Weir states that the manor at a later period
belonged to Edward Marsh, Esquire, of Hundle House, in the county
of Lincoln; by a descendant of whom it was sold to William
Hudson, Esquire, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; In 1659 it was sold
to one Duncombe, of whom it was purchased in 1688 by Sir Edmund
Turnor, of Stoke Rochford, Knight; in whose family it still
continues.&nbsp; Other proprietors are Richard Ward, Esq., and
Dr. Parkinson.</p>
<p>In <i>Domesday Book</i> there is mention of &ldquo;a church
and priest,&rdquo; the latter, therefore, being doubtless
resident in the parish; although for many years there has been no
residence for an incumbent.&nbsp; In 1830 the benefice was held,
with High Toynton, by the Rev. E. R. H. G. Palmer, a relative of
Viscount Halifax, who resided in Horncastle; in 1863 by the Rev.
Isaac Hall, who did the same; and it was not till 1869 that a
residence was erected at High Toynton for the united
benefices.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>Of the church, All Saints, we can only say that it
stands in a good position, on high ground; that its walls are
substantial, but that its style is of the meanest; it having been
rebuilt in the early part of the 19th century (1813); and beyond
a piscina, now in the north wall, it has no features of interest;
having wooden-framed windows, square painted pews, walls
whitewashed within and without, and a flat ceiling.&nbsp; It
greatly needs renovation, being now almost a solitary
representative, in the neighbourhood, of that very worst period
of architectural decadence.&nbsp; With fairly good sandstone in
the present walls, and probably more in the foundations of an
earlier church, to be exhumed, and an abundance <i>in situ</i>
not far away, restoration, or even re-erection, might be
effected, at a moderate outlay.</p>
<p>The one bell hangs in a shabby bell turret.&nbsp; While
repairs were being carried out in 1813 two nobles of Edward IV.,
two angels of Henry VII., and several silver coins of different
reigns, contained in a leathern purse, were found concealed in
the wall. <a name="citation185a"></a><a href="#footnote185a"

<h3>LOW TOYNTON.</h3>
<p>Low Toynton lies about a mile from Horncastle to the
north-east.&nbsp; It is approached through rich meadows, watered
by the river Waring. <a name="citation185b"></a><a
href="#footnote185b" class="citation">[185b]</a>&nbsp; The Rector
is the Rev. J. W. Bayldon, M.A., of Sidney Sussex College,
Cambridge.&nbsp; Overseers, G. E. Read and W. Scholey.&nbsp;
Letters <i>via</i> Horncastle arrive at 8.30.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Peter, is a small structure with
no pretention to architectural beauty, and almost entirely
covered with ivy.&nbsp; It was rebuilt in 1811, a period when
architectural taste was at its lowest ebb, and barbarisms in
stone, brick, and mortar were very generally perpetrated.&nbsp;
It was re-seated in 1863, during the incumbency of the Rev. E. M.
Chapman.&nbsp; It consists of chancel, nave, vestry, and open
belfry containing one bell.&nbsp; The chancel arch is the only
remnant of a former Norman structure.&nbsp; The font is
apparently a 14th century one, almost a replica of that in
Huttoft Church, which is engraved in <i>Lincs. Notes &amp;
Queries</i>, vol. iii, p. 225.&nbsp; The bowl is octagonal, its
faces filled with figures representing the Holy Trinity, the
virgin and child, and the 12 apostles.&nbsp; The bowl is joined
to the shaft by angelic figures round the lower part of it.&nbsp;
The octagonal shaft has figures of St. Paul, Mary Magdalen, a
bishop with chalice, another with scourge, and other subjects
much mutilated, at the base are the winged lion, ox, man, and
eagle, emblematical of the evangelists.&nbsp; The walls of the
church are relieved by some coloured designs, and borders of
ecclesiastical patterns, running round the windows, &amp;c.,
originally executed by that genuine artist the late Rev. C. P.
Terrot, Vicar of Wispington.&nbsp; These decorations have been
recently (1898) renewed by Mr. C. Hensman, of Horncastle, when
the church was thoroughly repaired, both inside and out; new
panelling placed in the nave, and a new window in the vestry; and
in the following year (1899) a new harmonium was purchased from
Messrs. Chappell and Co., London.</p>
<p>The east window is filled with modern coloured glass, the
subjects being the Transfiguration, the Crucifixion, and the
Ascension.&nbsp; On the sill of the east window are placed, over
the communion table, two handsomely carved <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>old oak
candlesticks, presented by the Rev. C. P. Terrot.&nbsp; On the
north wall of the nave there is a small oval brass tablet, which
was found in 1888, face downwards in the vestry floor.&nbsp; It
bears the following inscription: &ldquo;Here lyeth the body of
Edward Rolleston, Esquir, who departed this life the 23rd of
July, in the thirtey-fourth year of his age; interr&rsquo;d
underneath this place the 4th of August, A.D. 1687.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As 12 days elapsed between death and burial it is probable that
he died abroad.&nbsp; The manor and whole parish, except the
glebe, still belongs to the Rolleston family; the benefice being
in the patronage of the Earl of Ancaster.</p>
<p>In the floor of the chancel are two memorial slabs, one of the
Rev. R. Spranger, D.C.L., late Rector of Low Toynton and Creeton,
who enlarged the rectory house, and was a munificent benefactor
to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Among other good deeds he built the
bridge over the river Waring, on the road from Low Toynton to
Horncastle. <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a>&nbsp; He was a member of a family of
some distinction; had a residence in London, as well as his
rectory here; he was popularly said to drive the handsomest pair
of horses in London; and there exists a portrait in oil of an
ancestor, Chancellor Spranger, in one of the great galleries in
Florence.&nbsp; Dr. Spranger was an intimate friend of J. Keble,
the author of <i>The Christian Year</i>, and his son the Rev.
Robert J. Spranger, Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, spent the
greater part of his life in Mr. Keble&rsquo;s parish, Hursley,
Hants, as a voluntary assistant in his clerical work.</p>
<p>The companion slab marks the last resting place of another
rector, the Rev. J. Hutchinson, who died in 1788.&nbsp; His
history is singular.&nbsp; Although well educated, he enlisted as
a private in the army for foreign service; a commission however
was subsequently obtained for him by his friends.&nbsp; He
presently became attached to a lady who refused to marry a
soldier.&nbsp; He then determined to take holy orders.&nbsp;
Chance threw him in the way of a party of gentlemen at
Manchester, one of them being the agent of Lord Willoughby.&nbsp;
The latter stated that he had it in power, at that moment, to
bestow a benefice, and that he would give it to anyone who could
solve for him a particular problem.&nbsp; Mr. Hutchinson
succeeded in doing this, and was eventually appointed Rector of
Low Toynton.&nbsp; He held it, however, only 18 months, dying at
an early age.&nbsp; Whether he married the lady is not
stated.</p>
<p>In the List of Institutions to Benefices, preserved at
Lincoln, it is recorded that in 1562 Michael West, Clerk, was
appointed Rector of Nether Toynton and Vicar of Upper Toynton, by
Richard Bertie, Esq., ancestor of the Earl of Ancaster.&nbsp;
This must have been by some private arrangement with the Bishop
of Carlisle, who was patron of High Toynton; the Berties (as the
Willoughbies are now) being only patrons of Low Toynton.&nbsp;
From Liber Regis we learn that the Earl of Lindsey appointed to
the benefice in 1692, the Duke of Ancaster in 1778, Sir Peter
Burrell and Lady Willoughby d&rsquo; Eresby in 1783.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1585.&nbsp; Under date 1717, Feb. 2nd,
occurs the following entry: &ldquo;Robert Willy, of Upper
Toynton, did penance in the parish church of Lower Toynton, for
the heinous and great sin of adultery.&rdquo;&nbsp; A note in the
baptismal register states that on July 18th, 1818, Bishop George
(Tomline) confirmed at Horncastle 683 candidates, among them
being five from Low Toynton.&nbsp; Confirmations were not held so
frequently then as they now are.&nbsp; In this parish Mr. Thomas
Gibson, Vicar of Horncastle, when turned out of his preferment by
the Puritans, lived for some &ldquo;two years but poorly,
teaching a few pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Little is known of the early history of this parish or
of its proprietors.&nbsp; In a Chancery Inquisition post mortem,
11 Henry VII., No. 123, taken at Partney, after the death of
Isabella, wife of Richard Sapcote, Knight, the said Isabella is
declared by the jurors to have died seized of the Manor of Nether
Toynton, and of the advowson; and Joan, wife of William Nevill,
of Rolleston, Notts., and others are declared to be daughters and
heirs of the said Isabella; she herself being kinswoman and heir
of William Plesington, son of Henry Plesington, Knight. <a

<p>In a list of Lincolnshire names contained in the visitation of
1665&ndash;6, by William Dugdale, Esq., are Agnes Goodrick,
daughter of Robert Goodrick, of Toynton, and Bridget and
Elizabeth Rolston, daughters of Edward Rolston, of Toynton. <a

<p>By a Chancery Inquisition of 38 Henry VIII. (1546), it was
found that Thomas Dymoke, Esq., was seized of land in Over
Toynton, Nether Toynton, Maring-upon the-Hill, and other
parishes; and by an Inquisition of 36 Elizabeth, it was found
that Robert Dymock, Esq., was seized of the Manors of ffuletby
and Belchforde, and lands in Horncastle, Nether Tointon and Upper
Tointon, and several other parishes.&nbsp; He died without issue
13th Sept., 1594, and his only sister, Anne, widow of Charles
Bolle, of Haugh, succeeded to his property in Nether Toynton and
elsewhere; and thus the connection of the Dymokes with Low
Toynton ceased. <a name="citation187c"></a><a
href="#footnote187c" class="citation">[187c]</a></p>
<p>There is rather a curious feature in the following
record.&nbsp; By a Chancery Inquisition post mortem, 24 Henry
VII., No. 61, it is found that Humphrey <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Conyngsby,
Sergeant at Law, and others, instituted a suit on behalf of
William Stavely, and others, by which he recovered to them, among
other properties, &ldquo;the advowson of Nether Taunton, and the
rent of 4&frac12; quarters of salt, in Nether Taunton, Over
Taunton, and other parishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now find another ancient name connected with this
parish.&nbsp; The Newcomens (originally Le Newcomen, or the
newcomer) of Saltfleetby, were one of our oldest Lincolnshire
families.&nbsp; They are named in Yorke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Union of
Honour,&rdquo; and their pedigrees given in four Lincolnshire
Visitations.&nbsp; The number of branches into which the race
spread is remarkable. <a name="citation188a"></a><a
href="#footnote188a" class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; Andrew
Newcomen lived in the time of Richard I., resident at
Saltfleetby, where the headquarters of the family continued for
many generations.&nbsp; Robert Newcomen (1304) married Alice,
daughter of Sir William Somercotes, Knight.&nbsp; His son, also
Robert, married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Hardingshall,
Knight.&nbsp; Another Robert (1452) married Joane, daughter of
Robert Craycroft, of Craycroft Hall.&nbsp; A daughter Katharine,
of Brian Newcomen, married (1559) George Bolle, of Haugh, a
family already mentioned as, a few years later, connected with
Low Toynton.&nbsp; In 1540 we find Richard Newcomen residing at
Nether Toynton.&nbsp; By his will, dated 3rd Sept., 1540, he
requests that he may be buried in the church of St. Peter, Nether
Toynton.&nbsp; He appoints the right worshipful Edward Dymoke,
supervisor.&nbsp; His grandson, Samuel Newcomen, of Nether
Toynton, married Frances, daughter of Thomas Massingberd, of
Braytoft Hall, M.P. for Calais (1552).&nbsp; This branch of the
family seems to have died out in the person of Thomas Newcomen
(1592); <a name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b"
class="citation">[188b]</a> but other branches spread over the
neighbourhood, and were established at Bag Enderby, East Kirkby,
Withern, and other places, and flourished throughout the 17th
century.&nbsp; Another Newcomen early in the 18th century married
a daughter of Sir Robert Barkham, Bart.</p>
<p>A renewal of connection with Low Toynton was made when the
widow of Nicholas Newcomen married, circa 1700, the Honble.
Charles Bertie, son of Robert, 4th Earl of Lindsey, patron of the
benefice of Nether Toynton.&nbsp; Arthur Bocher, Esq., of Low
Toynton, was in the Lincolnshire Rebellion of 1536, being
brother-in-law of Thomas Moygne, one of the leaders in the
movement.</p>
<p>Thus the parish of Low Toynton has had residents, proprietors,
and rectors, to whom its present inhabitants may look back with
some degree of pride and pleasure, although &ldquo;their place
now knoweth them no more.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>ROUGHTON.</h3>
<p>This village stands on the west bank of the river Bain, about
4 miles to the south of Horncastle.&nbsp; It is bounded on the
north by Thornton and Martin, on the east by Haltham and
Dalderby, on the south by Kirkby-on-Bain, and on the west by
Kirkstead, Kirkby, and Woodhall.&nbsp; The area is 1020 acres,
rateable value &pound;945, population 137, entirely
agricultural.&nbsp; The soil is loam, on kimeridge clay, with
&ldquo;Bain terrace&rdquo; gravel deposits.</p>
<p>The nearest railway stations are at Horncastle and Woodhall
Spa, each about four miles distant.&nbsp; There is an award and
map of Haltham and Roughton in the parish, and a copy at the
County Council office, Lincoln.&nbsp; Three <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>roads meet
in the middle of the village, one from Horncastle, one to
Woodhall Spa and Kirkstead, one to Kirkby-on-Bain, Coningsby and
Tattershall.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Hawley, Bart., of Tumby Lawn, in the adjoining
parish of Kirkby, is Lord of the Manor, but Lady Hartwell
(daughter of the late Sir Henry Dymoke, the King&rsquo;s
Champion), and the executors of the Clinton family (now Clinton
Baker) and the Rector own most of the soil; there being a few
small proprietors.&nbsp; Roughton Hall, the property of Lady
Hartwell, is occupied by F. G. Hayward, Esq.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1564.&nbsp; Peculiar entries are those
of 43 burials for the years 1631&ndash;2, including those of the
Rector and his two daughters, who died within a few days of each
other; this was from the visitation called &ldquo;The
Plague,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Black Death.&rdquo;&nbsp; For some
years before 1657 only civil marriages were valid in law, and
Judge Filkin is named in the register as marrying the Rector of
Roughton, John Barcroft, to Ann Coulen.&nbsp; In 1707 Mary Would
is named as overseer of the parish, it being very unusual at that
period for women to hold office.&nbsp; Another entry, in the
overseer&rsquo;s book, needs an explanation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Simon
Grant, for 1 day&rsquo;s work of bages, 2s. 6d.;&rdquo; and
again, &ldquo;Simon flint, for 1 day&rsquo;s work of bages, 2s.
6d.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bage&rdquo; was the turf, cut for
burning; in this case being cut from the &ldquo;church
moor,&rdquo; for the church fire.&nbsp; It was severe labour,
often producing rupture of the labourer&rsquo;s body, hence the
high pay.</p>
<p>There is a charity named the &ldquo;Chamerlayne Dole,&rdquo;
of 10s., given yearly to the poor, left by Martha Chamerlayn in
1702.&nbsp; It is a charge upon a cottage and garden owned by Mr.
T. Jackson, of Horncastle.</p>
<p>The National School was established about 1860, in a building
erected in 1834 as a Wesleyan Chapel.&nbsp; It was enlarged in
1872 and 1879.&nbsp; It is supported by a voluntary rate.</p>
<p>The Church, St. Margaret&rsquo;s, is of no architectural
beauty, being built of brick and sandstone.&nbsp; It consists of
nave and chancel, with castellated tower, having one bell, also
castellated parapets at the north and south corners of the east
chancel wall.&nbsp; The font is Norman, circular, with circular
pediment, having an old oak octagonal cover, cupola shaped, plain
except slight carving round the rim.&nbsp; The fabric was newly
roofed in 1870, when it was fitted with good open benches, the
chancel paved with encaustic tiles, and the windows partly filled
with stained glass; there are fragments of a former carved rood
screen, the pulpit being of plain old oak.</p>
<p>In the chancel is a lengthy inscription, commemorative of
Norreys Fynes; Esq., of Whitehall, in the adjoining parish of
Martin.&nbsp; He was grandson of Sir Henry Clinton, eldest son of
Henry, Earl of Lincoln, by his second wife, daughter of Sir
Richard Morrison, and mother of Francis, Lord Norreys, afterwards
Earl of Berkshire.&nbsp; He was a non-juror.&nbsp; He died
January 10th, 1735&ndash;6, aged 74.&nbsp; There is a murial
tablet to the memory of the Rev. Arthur Rockliffe, who died in
1798; another to Charles Pilkington, Esq., who died in 1798, and
Abigail, his wife, who died in 1817.</p>
<p>The benefice is a discharged rectory, united to that of
Haltham in 1741, and now held by the Rev. H. Spurrier, the patron
being his son the Rev. H. C. M. Spurrier.&nbsp; The two benefices
together are valued at &pound;450 a year.&nbsp; There is a good
rectory house.&nbsp; The church plate is modern.&nbsp; The
village feast was discontinued about 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Peculiar field names are the Low Ings, Bottom Slabs, Carr
Bottom, <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Church Moor, Honey Hole, Wong,
Well-syke, Long Sand, Madam Clay, Sewer Close. <a
name="citation190a"></a><a href="#footnote190a"
class="citation">[190a]</a></p>
<p>As to the early history of Roughton, <i>Domesday Book</i>
gives it among the possessions of William the Conqueror, and also
as belonging to Robert Despenser, his powerful steward, who
probably held it under the king.&nbsp; A Chancery Inquisition
post mortem, 22 Richard II., No. 13, A.D. 1399, shows that Ralph
de Cromwell, jointly with his wife Matilda, held the adjoining
Manor of Tumby, with appurtenances in Roughton and
elsewhere.&nbsp; While another Inquisition of 13 Henry VII., No.
34, shows that the said Matilda died, &ldquo;seised in fee tail
of the same lands.&rdquo; <a name="citation190b"></a><a
href="#footnote190b" class="citation">[190b]</a></p>
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth a family of Eastwoods resided here,
since the name of Andrew Eastwood, of Roughton, appears in the
list (published by T. C. Noble) of those gentry who contributed
&pound;25 to the Armada Fund.&nbsp; Other documents shew that at
different periods the hall has been occupied by members of
various county families, as Fynes (already named), Wichcote,
Heneage, Dymoke, Pilkington, and Beaumont.</p>
<p>The register has the following entries, probably written by an
illiterate parish clerk, &ldquo;An the wife of Will. Hennag, was
buered ye 9 of Feberery, 1729.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame
Elizabeth fines was buered May ye 29, 1730.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gervase Holles gives the following arms as existing in the
church in his day.</p>

<h3>HALTHAM.</h3>
<p>This village is distant from Horncastle between four and five
miles in a southerly direction, lying on the east side of the
river Bain.&nbsp; It is bounded on the north by Dalderby and
Scrivelsby, on the south by Kirkby and its hamlet of Fulsby, on
the east by Scrivelsby, Wood Enderby and Wilksby, and on the west
by Roughton.&nbsp; The area is 2380 acres, rateable value
&pound;1198.&nbsp; The soil is loam, with kimeridge clay below,
and gravel deposits.&nbsp; Population 121, mainly
agricultural.</p>
<p>The main roads lead to Dalderby, Scrivelsby, and Horncastle,
to Kirkby, Mareham-le-Fen, Coningsby, and Tattershall, and to
Wood Enderby, Wilksby, and Revesby.&nbsp; The nearest railway
station is at Horncastle.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Manor was formerly the Champion Dymoke of
Scrivelsby Court, but the late Rev. John Dymoke sold his estate
in this parish, and the <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>manor is
now the property of Sir H. M. Hawley, Bart., of Tumby Lawn, in
the adjoining parish of Kirkby; W. H. Trafford, Esq., owning the
remainder, except 150 acres of glebe.</p>
<p>The benefice was united to that of Roughton in 1741, the two
being now of the yearly value of &pound;450, and held by the Rev.
H. Spurrier.&nbsp; The patron is the rector&rsquo;s eldest son,
the Rev. H. C. M. Spurrier.&nbsp; There is an award and map of
Haltham and Roughton, of date 1775.&nbsp; A village feast is held
on St. Benedict&rsquo;s Day (March 21), he being the patron saint
of the church.</p>
<p>There are some peculiar field names; as the Far, Middle, and
Near Redlands, arable; the Top and Lower Brock-holes (brock
meaning a badger), arable; the Black Sands, pasture; the Top and
Low Malingars, arable; the East, West, and South High Rimes,
arable; the Pingle, meadow; the Croft, pasture; the Oaks,
pasture; Wood Close Meadow, the Old Cow Pasture.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1561, and contains an entry for the
year 1684: &ldquo;This yeare plague in Haltham.&rdquo; <a
name="citation191"></a><a href="#footnote191"
class="citation">[191]</a>&nbsp; There is a charity, the interest
of &pound;5, left by John Dymoke, Esq., of Haltham, who in 1634
is named among the Heralds&rsquo; List of Gentry, for yearly
distribution by the overseers among the poor.&nbsp; The children
attend the school at Roughton.</p>
<p>The church is one of the most interesting in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The chancel was restored and an open roof
put up in 1881, at a cost of &pound;250.&nbsp; The nave was
restored in 1891, at a cost of &pound;300.&nbsp; The sanctuary
was paved with Minton tiles by the late Lady Dymoke.&nbsp; The
most remarkable feature is a semi-circular tympanum over the door
in the south porch, which is of early Norman, or possibly Saxon
date.&nbsp; It has sculptured on it in somewhat rude fashion a
Maltese cross within a circle, a second circle running through
the limbs of the cross, a square with three-quarter circles at
its corners, and semicircles midway of each side, which form the
extremities of another cross, and between the limbs are
roundels.&nbsp; Below is a figure resembling a fish, also four
rows of triangles, and other complicated devices.&nbsp; The east
window is a very fine flamboyant one, of date about 1350.&nbsp;
Some of the sittings have very old rudely-carved poppy heads of
oak.&nbsp; There are very fine carved oak canopies over two long
pews in the north aisle, for the Champion Dymokes and their
servants.&nbsp; There is a piscina with two fronts in the south
wall of the chancel, and a series of three stone sedilia, in the
north wall is an aumbrey.&nbsp; There is an incised slab to one
of the Dymokes.&nbsp; The tower has three bells, and the bell
chamber is closed by ancient boarding, on which are the ten
commandments in old characters, and very curious Royal Arms of
Charles I.&nbsp; The church plate consists of pewter paten,
silver flagon and chalice, with date 1764, given by Mr. John
Dickinson.</p>
<p>In the village there is an old hostel, partly of the Tudor
style, with pointed gable ends, projecting upper storey, and
constructed externally of brick and woodwork.</p>
<p>As to the early history of this parish little is definitely
known.&nbsp; According to <i>Domesday Book</i> it was among the
possessions of the Conqueror, and his steward, Robert Dispenser,
held it under him.&nbsp; Probably like other parishes in the soke
of Horncastle, the manor was held by Gerbald d&rsquo; Escald, his
grandson Gerard de Rhodes, his son Ralph de Rhodes, sold by him
to the Bishop of Carlisle, &amp;c.&nbsp; Of the ownership of
Ralph de Rhodes we have evidence in a Feet of Fines, Lincoln, 9
Henry III., No. 52, containing an agreement between <!-- page

<h3>MAREHAM-LE-FEN.</h3>
<p>Mareham-le-Fen lies about six miles south from Horncastle, and
five miles eastward of Tattershall station, with a population of
more than 800.&nbsp; Letters <i>via</i> Boston arrive by mail
cart at 7.30 a.m.&nbsp; This is the seat of a considerable
industry, carried on by Mr. Titus Kime, as a grower of greatly
improved varities of potatoes, agricultural seed, and, latterly
on a large scale, of bulbs of different kinds, in which he seems
likely to compete with the Dutch trade.</p>
<p>The church, which is dedicated to St. Helen, is a fine
structure of oolite stone, probably one of the largest in the
neighbourhood, except the collegiate church of Tattershall.&nbsp;
It consists of tower, nave, north and south aisles, south porch
and chancel.&nbsp; The body of the church was restored in 1873,
and re-opened on June 13th of that year, at a cost of more than
&pound;2,000, by J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., Lord of the Manor; the
then rector, the Rev. W. Sharpe restoring the chancel, and the
parishioners and other friends the tower.&nbsp; The latter
consists of three tiers, having a small square window in the
south <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>and north walls below, with a
two-light floriated window on the west.&nbsp; In the tier above
are two-light windows on all four faces.&nbsp; At the summit it
has battlements and four tall pinnacles.&nbsp; There are three
bells, the date of the largest being 1627.&nbsp; The body of the
church is also battlemented, and has pinnacles, the westernmost
of these having the figures, within a niche, of St. George and
the dragon.</p>
<p>The south porch has an early English doorway within, the outer
one being modern.&nbsp; In the moulding above the inner doorway
is a curiously crowned head, probably representing the Empress
Helena, the patron saint; other curious devices running down the
moulding on each side.&nbsp; To the right of the inner doorway
are initials M.S., date 1681.&nbsp; The font has a large
octagonal bowl, with heads at the angles, and elaborate trefoil
devices on the faces; the shaft is plain, octagonal, the pediment
a stone cross.</p>

"St. Helen&rsquo;s Church, Mareham-Le-Fen"

</a></p>
<p>Both aisles have four lofty bays, with early English
columns.&nbsp; In the north aisle is one three-light
perpendicular trefoiled window, in its western wall; in the north
wall, on each side of the north door, is a three-light
perpendicular window, with mullions interlacing; and to the east
a four-light round-headed trefoiled window.&nbsp; Over the north
door is a tablet, with a Latin inscription, commemorative of the
Rev. H. Sheppard, a former rector, who died 24th Jan., 1764, aged
62.&nbsp; Beneath it is a cherub with outspread wings.&nbsp; In
the wall, east of the north door, is a tablet bearing the
inscription: &ldquo;This church was relighted in memory of
Francis Thorpe, who lost his life, by an accident, while working
in the church near this spot, 22nd Sept., 1892.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
south aisle, at the west end, has a three-light broad interlaced
window.&nbsp; In the south wall, west of the porch, is a low
doorway, now filled in, with step at its base, probably formerly
leading to a parvis, or priest&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; East of the
<!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>porch are two round-headed three-light trefoiled
perpendicular windows.&nbsp; In the chancel the east window, of
coloured glass, is lofty, with three lights, and six trefoils
above.&nbsp; The subjects are divided into upper and lower rows;
the upper are the Ascension in the centre, with the Resurrection
to the left, and to the right the disciples grouped round the
virgin; the lower are the Crucifixion in the centre, Christ
bearing His cross to the left, and the entombment to the
right.&nbsp; This window was by Lavers, Barrand and Westlake; it
was given in memory of the late Mr. Joseph Corbett, by his son,
C. J. Corbett, Architect, of Imber Court, Surrey.</p>
<p>The reredos has three compartments; the central device is a
cross, with rays of glory, and the monogram I.H.S.; on the right
and left are doubly pointed, crocheted, arches; the device in the
northernmost being a crown of thorns, with the three nails,
surrounded by a circle; next to it three interlaced circles; on
the south side interlaced triangles, and a plain cross.&nbsp; The
east wall, up to the height of the reredos, is faced with
alabaster.</p>
<p>In the south wall of the chancel is a wide stone seat, and
above it a two-light trefoiled window.&nbsp; In the north chancel
wall is a trefoiled credence table.&nbsp; There is a tablet to
the memory of William Goodenough, formerly rector, Archdeacon of
Carlisle (the benefice formerly being in the patronage of the
Bishops of Carlisle), who died 13th Dec., 1854; and commemorating
his wife Mary Anne, daughter of Dr. Samuel Goodenough, Bishop of
Carlisle; she dying 3rd Jan., 1847, aged 75.&nbsp; The memorial
was erected by their only surviving child, Mrs. Hawkins.</p>
<p>The choir sittings are of carved modern oak; the pulpit is
also of the same, on a stone base, and the lectern.&nbsp; The
chancel arch is lofty, the modern side columns having richly
carved capitals.&nbsp; Some of the stones of the original arch
were found built into the chimney of a cottage near at
hand.&nbsp; The sittings in the nave, and the roof timbers, are
of pitch pine.&nbsp; The base of the tower forms a roomy
vestry.</p>
<p>In the churchyard is the lower part of the shaft of a cross,
standing on an octagonal base.&nbsp; Opposite the east end of the
south aisle is a tombstone in memory of James Roberts, &ldquo;who
sailed round the world in company with Sir Joseph Banks, in the
years 1768&ndash;71, on board H.M.S. the Endeavour, Lieut. James
Cook, Commander,&rdquo; attending him &ldquo;also on other
voyages.&rdquo; <a name="citation194a"></a><a
href="#footnote194a" class="citation">[194a]</a>&nbsp; The tomb
of Archdeacon Goodenough is on the north-east side of the
church.&nbsp; Within a few feet of the south buttress of the
tower is a fragment of an old tombstone, shewing part of a
foliated cross on both sides, and the monogram I.H.S., in old
characters, probably Saxon; Mareham being one of the 222 parishes
in the county which had a church in Saxon times <a

<p>Gervase Holles (temp. Chas. I.) gives the following arms and

<p>The register dates from 1558.&nbsp; An entry records that on
22nd Nov., 1685, a &ldquo;Briefe was read and published, for
Saresden in Oxfordshire, for loss valued at &pound;1,449.&nbsp;
Granted June 14th, 1686.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another entry, under date
23rd Nov., 1685, is as follows: &ldquo;Thomas Eresby of Revvesby
maketh oath yt Theodosie, his daughter, who was buried in the
churchyard upon Sunday last, was wound and wrapped up in woollen
only, according to the late Act of Parliament, in yt case
made.&rdquo;&nbsp; In explanation of this it may be stated that
in 1677 British and Irish woollens were prohibited in France,
which injured the woollen trade very much; and in the next year
(1678) in order to encourage the trade at home, it was enacted by
29 Charles II., c. 3, that all persons, except those who died of
the plague, should be buried in wool, under a penalty of
&pound;5. <a name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a>&nbsp; Another entry states that a
collection was made, the amount not known, to afford relief,
after the great fire in London, Sept., 1666.</p>
<p>The rectory, adjoining the church, stands in a large, well
wooded garden.&nbsp; It is a good substantial residence, rebuilt
by Archdeacon Goodenough in 1818&ndash;19, and much improved in
1855.&nbsp; In the entrance hall are two old prints of the church
and rectory before their restoration, dated 1785.&nbsp; They were
presented to the late rector, Rev. W. Sharpe, by Alfred Cobbett,
Esq., and they are preserved as heirlooms by the rectors for the
time being.&nbsp; The Rev. F. J. Williamson is the present
rector, late of Lydgate.&nbsp; The Bishop of Manchester is patron
of the benefice; the patronage of this, and several other
benefices in this neighbourhood, formerly held by the Bishops of
Carlisle, being transferred to the See of Manchester some years
after its creation, in 1848.</p>
<p>The national school, built in 1840, is endowed with nearly an
acre of land, given by Archdeacon Goodenough; it was considerably
enlarged by J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., in 1877.&nbsp; Some of the
inhabitants are entitled to the benefits of the almshouses at
Revesby.&nbsp; There is a navigable drain from the Witham,
passing near the village, affording communication with New
Bolingbroke and Boston.&nbsp; A former part of the parish is now
included in the district of Wildmoor Fen.</p>
<p>In Liber Regis this parish is named &ldquo;Marrow, alias
Marym, alias Mareham in le Fen.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is called in
<i>Domesday Book</i> Meringe (or the sea-ing, <i>i.e.</i>
sea-meadow).&nbsp; Another form was Marum; the Revesby Charters,
Nos. 47 and 48, mention a piece of land, near the boundary of
Marum, called &ldquo;Mare Furlong,&rdquo; and the grass (Psamma
arenaria) which now grows on the sea banks is commonly called
Marrum grass.&nbsp; All these names probably refer to the marish
(Latin, mariscum), or marsh, character of the locality, caused by
its proximity to the sea (le mer), which then came much nearer
than it does now, and frequently flooded the land.</p>
<p>The manor was given by the Conqueror to the powerful Norman,
Robert Despenser, who, as his name implies, was the King&rsquo;s
High Steward.&nbsp; He was the ancestor of the Despensers, Earls
of Gloucester, and he held 15 manors in <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Lincolnshire alone, besides 17 in Leicestershire, and
several in other counties.&nbsp; Much of the land of this parish
was at a later period given to Revesby Abbey, and at the
dissolution of the monasteries some of this was granted by Henry
VIII, to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. <a
name="citation196a"></a><a href="#footnote196a"
class="citation">[196a]</a>&nbsp; In later times it became, by
purchase, the property of Mr. Joseph Banks, M.P. for Grimsby,
born in 1681, and eventually came to his distinguished
descendant, Sir Joseph Banks; and on his death some of the
Mareham land passed to the ancestors of the present Sir Henry M.
Hawley.&nbsp; Other proprietors are now Major Gape, Messrs. J. R.
Chapman, Joseph Lake, and other smaller owners.</p>
<p>Among the Lincolnshire gentry called upon (with the
Massingberds, Heneages, and many others) to furnish
&ldquo;launces and light horse,&rdquo; in the 16th century, when
the Spanish armada was expected, was one &ldquo;John May of
Mairing,&rdquo; who failed to present himself at the muster in
1584, but in 1586 supplied &ldquo;one light horse.&rdquo; <a

<p>In Notes on Low Toynton mention is made of the old family of
Newcomen, originally &ldquo;of Salaby,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
Saltfleetby, where many generations of them were buried, from the
time of Richard I.&nbsp; They married into influential and titled
families, in various parts of the county.&nbsp; Charles Newcomen
lived at Hagnaby in 1634, and bought land in Revesby.&nbsp; A
Newcomen lived in Mareham in the 17th century.&nbsp; They were
connected, by marriage, with the family of Sir Joseph Banks, as
Mr. Banks, grandfather of Sir Joseph, had a house in Lincoln, the
adjoining one being occupied by Newcomen Wallis, Esq., and Mr.
Banks married Catherine the widow of Mr. Wallis (see the Banks
monument in Revesby church, north aisle), whose mother was
daughter and co-heir of Nicholas Newcomen, Esq. <a
name="citation196c"></a><a href="#footnote196c"
class="citation">[196c]</a></p>
<p>We here give a few old records in connection with this parish
in the past.&nbsp; The Court Roll of Mareham-le-Fen (preserved
among the documents of the Listers of Burwell) for 2 Elizabeth,
shows that, at that date (A.D. 1559), Thomas Glenham, Esq.
(variously written Glemham), had the Manor of Mareham.&nbsp; In
the 23rd Elizabeth it is recorded that Charles Glenham, Esq., by
his lawful attorney, Francis Colby, of Glenham Parva, Esq.,
granted leases for seven years to divers tenants in
Mareham.&nbsp; Thomas owned also the Manors of Calceby,
Belchford, Oxcomb, and Burwell; these he sold to Sir Matthew
Lister, afterwards of Burwell.&nbsp; He married Amye, daughter of
Sir Henry Parker. <a name="citation196d"></a><a
href="#footnote196d" class="citation">[196d]</a></p>
<p>In a suit, instituted 29th May, 1239, between William de
Bavent, plaintiff, and Walter, Bishop of Carlisle, defendant,
regarding the advowson of the church of &ldquo;Merum,&rdquo; the
said William &ldquo;quit claimed&rdquo; all his right to the said
advowson, to the bishop and his heirs for ever; and in return for
this the bishop gave him 10 marks.&nbsp; In the old record, Testa
de Nevill, folio 556 (circa 1326), Walter de Bavent held certain
lands in Marum, &ldquo;by service of falconry,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
by providing yearly, in lieu of rent, one &ldquo;gay
goss-hawk,&rdquo; or more, for the use of the Lord of the Manor.

<p>Henry Ayscough, of Blyborough, by will dated 19 Oct., 1611,
left lands in Mareham-le-Fen, and the Manor of Tumby, and other
lands, to his grandsons.&nbsp; <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>In
connection with this we may mention that the late Sir Henry James
Hawley married, as his first wife, Elizabeth Askew, a descendant
of the same family.&nbsp; The Ayscoughs (or Askews) were a
distinguished Lincolnshire and Yorkshire family, and have still
numerous representatives. <a name="citation198a"></a><a
href="#footnote198a" class="citation">[198a]</a></p>
<p>Here is another record of the same family.&nbsp; By will,
dated 15th April, 1612, Walter Ayscoughe, of Mareham-le-Fen, left
to his wife Bridget &pound;20 annuity, and other property, for
her life; then to his sons Henry and Walter, and two daughters
Margaret and Elizabeth; also 12d. to the same; and 5s. to
Nicholas Cressey, gent, supervisor, witness Clynton Ayscoughe;
proved at Horncastle, 2nd May, 1613.&nbsp; To this family
belonged Anne Askew the martyr, who was the younger daughter of
Sir William Ayscough, Bart., of Stallingborough.&nbsp; Their
property eventually came to the late Ascoghe Boucherett, of South
Willingham.</p>
<p>Next we find one of the old family of Newcomen, already
referred to, &ldquo;Edward Newcomen of Mareham-le-Fenne, by will,
proved at Horncastle, 1st July, 1614,&rdquo; leaving to his
daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, &pound;10 each, the same to his
son Robert, and the residue to his wife; the personality being
&pound;120 3s. 8d., a vastly larger sum in those days than
now.</p>
<p>Another will is that of Annie Elie, widow, of Mareham-le-Fen,
dated 13th July, 1616, in which she desires &ldquo;to be buried
in the church,&rdquo; so that she was probably some one of
importance.&nbsp; She leaves everything to her son-in-law John
Wymberley, and her daughter Susan Wymberley. <a

<p>Among the deeds and charters of Revesby Abbey, privately
printed by the Right Hon. E. Stanhope a few years ago, No. 24
gives, among the witnesses to a deed of gift, the name of Eda,
wife of Richard, Priest of Mareham (temp. Henry II., or Richard
I).&nbsp; Hence it is evident that celibacy was not strictly
enforced on the clergy at that period. <a

Abbey (No. 29), by a certain John, is stamped with a round seal,
having an equestrian figure, and the legend Sigillum Johannis de
Maringe.&nbsp; By another deed William, son of John of Maring,
gives certain lands; the seal bearing a lion and dog, or fox
&ldquo;contourn&eacute; regardant,&rdquo; <a
name="citation198d"></a><a href="#footnote198d"
class="citation">[198d]</a> the legend of this is Sigill. Will.
de Marige.</p>
<p>With these records and associations with the past, the parish
of Mareham may surely be said to have a history on which its
people may well look back with interest and satisfaction.</p>
<h3>MOORBY.</h3>
<p>Moorby lies about 4&frac12; miles from Horncastle, and about
1&frac12; miles beyond Scrivelsby, in a south-easterly
direction.&nbsp; Letters <i>via</i> Boston arrive at 9.30.</p>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>The registers date from 1561, but contain no entries of
any particular interest.&nbsp; The church, dedicated to All
Saints, has undergone several transformations.&nbsp; This was one
of the 222 parishes which possessed a church before the Norman
conquest, and it still contains a fragment (to be noticed later
on) which is apparently of Saxon origin.&nbsp; Both Weir in his
History (1828), and Saunders (1834) agree in stating that in the
early part of the 19th century the church was &ldquo;totally
destitute of interest.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The Gazetteer</i> of 1863
describes it vaguely as a &ldquo;Gothic structure.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was rebuilt in 1864, from designs by Mr. James Fowler,
Architect, of Louth, at a cost of &pound;1,100, defrayed by J.
Banks Stanhope, Esq., Lord of the Manor; and was further repaired
in 1891, by public subscription.&nbsp; It consists of nave,
chancel, vestry, north porch, and small square tower at the
north-west angle, with low spire containing one bell.&nbsp; It is
built chiefly of brick with facings of Ancaster stone.</p>
<p>In the north wall of the nave are a couple of two-light
windows, in the Perpendicular style; in the south wall are three
two-light windows; all these having bands of red and black brick
alternately.&nbsp; In the west wall are two single-light lancet
windows, with an ox-eye window above.&nbsp; In the chancel there
is a small lancet window in the north wall, and a square
aumbrey.&nbsp; The east end has a three-light plain lancet
window; beneath which is a stone reredos, having three
compartments filled with encaustic tiles, having, as their
designs, in the centre a cross in gilt, and Alpha and Omega,
within ox-eyes, on either side.&nbsp; In the south wall in front
of the vestry is a lancet-shaped doorway, and, west of it, an
arcade of two lancet apertures, supported by four columns of
serpentine.&nbsp; Within the vestry is a two-light lancet window;
and let into the eastern wall is a small slab, having four
grotesque figures, one blowing a kind of bagpipe, the others
dancing.&nbsp; This is said to have been a portion of a
&ldquo;minstrel pillar,&rdquo; it is apparently Saxon, and is
probably a relic from the original fabric.&nbsp; The chancel arch
is of red and black bricks, in alternate bands, the capitals
nicely carved in stone, supported by small serpentine
columns.&nbsp; The pulpit is of Caen stone, having a cross within
a circle on the front panel, and one serpentine column.&nbsp; The
chancel choir stalls are of good modern oak; the sittings in the
nave and the roof being of pitch pine.</p>
<p>The font is the most remarkable feature of the church.&nbsp;
It has a large square bowl; the device on the east side is a
skeleton being drawn from the tomb by two angels, doubtless
emblematic of the &ldquo;death unto sin and new birth unto
righteousness,&rdquo; accomplished in baptism.&nbsp; On the north
face is the virgin and child, with the sun and moon in the
corners above.&nbsp; On the south side is a figure in long
vestment, apparently sitting on an altar, much defaced.&nbsp; On
the west are six figures, much defaced, in the attitude of
prayer.&nbsp; At the four angles are quatrefoiled niches, having
at their bases, alternately, a crowned head and a mitre.&nbsp;
This may have been of the 14th century.&nbsp; The shaft is square
and modern, with columns at the angles.</p>
<p>The communion plate is modern, except the paten, which bears
the inscription &ldquo;Matthew Sympson, M.A., instituted Rector
of Moorby, Feb. 28, 1705, collated Prebendary of Lincoln, June
25, 1718, Rector of Wenington, May 29, 1728.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
present Rector is the Rev. R. C. Oake, late Vicar of Broughton,
Manchester.&nbsp; The rectory of Moorby is consolidated with the
vicarage of Wood Enderby.</p>
<p>By deed dated Nov. 24th, 1855, the guardians of the poor, by
consent of the ratepayers, gave certain land in Moorby for the
site of a parish school to the minister, churchwardens, and
overseers, and their successors; and more <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>recently a
school district has been formed for the parishes of Moorby, Wood
Enderby, Claxby, and Wilksby; the school, which was built in
1855, being enlarged in 1872, to provide the accommodation
required by this union.</p>
<p>Moorby was one of the &ldquo;thousand four hundred and
forty-two manors&rdquo; which William the Conqueror took as his
own portion, when he divided the lands of England among his
Norman followers.&nbsp; Being in the Soke of Horncastle, it was
doubtless granted, along with that manor, and those of West
Ashby, High Toynton, and several others, to Adelias or Alice de
Cundi, daughter of William de Cheney, Lord of Caenby ann
Glentham, and wife of Roger de Cundi.&nbsp; As she took part
against King Stephen, in favour of the Empress Maud, he took the
property from her; but eventually restored it to her, on
condition that she should demolish her castle at Horncastle; this
however was only for life, the estates again reverting to the
crown.&nbsp; Henry II. made a grant of them to Gerbald le Escald,
a Fleming noble, who was succeeded by his grandson and heir,
Gerard de Rhodes.&nbsp; His son, Ralph de Rhodes, in the reign of
Henry III., sold the manors to Walter Mauclerke, Bishop of
Carlisle, and until recently the patronage of Moorby benefice
belonged to the Bishops of Carlisle.&nbsp; After the creation of
the See of Manchester, the patronage, with that of High Toynton,
Mareham-le-Fen, &amp;c., was transferred to the Bishops of
Manchester.</p>
<p><i>Domesday Book</i>, describing the soke of the Manor of
Horncastle, says &ldquo;In Morebi there are 3 carucates of land
(or about 360 acres).&nbsp; There are 6 soc-men, and 10 bordars,
who have 4 carucates (or 480 acres).&nbsp; There is a church and
a priest (evidently a resident; of whom, according to Sir Henry
Ellis, there were only 130 in the country), and 240 acres of
meadow and 6 acres of underwood.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the old record,
Testa de Nevill (circa 1326&ndash;1328), the benefice of
&ldquo;Morby&rdquo; is said to be &ldquo;of the gift of the lord
the king,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> Edward II. or III.&nbsp; The
original charters of Henry III., granting these manors to the
Bishops of Carlisle, were confirmed by Henry VI.; but in course
of time they passed to the Brandons, and to various other
proprietors, until the ancestor of Sir Joseph Banks became lessee
of the Manor of Horncastle, and also acquired the Manor of
Moorby; to which James Banks Stanhope, Esq., and the late Right
Hon. Edward Stanhope succeeded; although T. Elsey, the Artindale
family, and the trustees of Bardney school, own portions of the
parish.</p>
<p>In the year 1554 (Aug. 6th) Thomas Bewley, Clerk, was admitted
to this benefice by Robert, Bishop of Carlisle, it being
&ldquo;vacant by deprivation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the 2nd year
of the reign of Queen Mary, of ill memory.&nbsp; Doubtless the
offence of the ejected predecessor was that he was married, which
was contrary to the papistic ideas, revived in that brief
reign.&nbsp; Numbers of beneficed clergy were deprived at that
time for this offence.</p>
<p>A few old records of some interest are preserved connected
with Moorby, of which we give two or three samples here.&nbsp;
First we have a family of the name of Moreby, of whom more than
one mention is made.&nbsp; Roger Moreby, by will dated Saturday
after the Feast of St. Botolph, 1394, commends his soul to St.
Mary and all the saints; he requests that his body may be buried
in Croyland parish church; he leaves 40s. to be given to the poor
on the day of his burial, and money to provide torches and wax
for the church, and the altars of St. Katharine, St. John the
Baptist, and Holy Trinity; he bequeaths &pound;10 of silver to
his wife, and other items.&nbsp; Again, by will dated the Feast
of St. Thomas the apostle, 1368, Gervase de Wylleford bequeaths
100s. to John Moreby his cousin.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>The family of Ayscough, formerly so widely represented
in the county, were connected with Moorby.&nbsp; By will, dated
16th Nov., 1601, Henry Ascoughe, Gent., desires to be buried in
the parish church of &ldquo;Morebie,&rdquo; leaving to his sister
&ldquo;Elizabeth Aiscoughe (his) hereditaments in Morebie for
life, then to go to his brother Matthew.&rdquo;&nbsp; His sister
is also to have lands which he had leased to Sir Henry Glenham,
Knight. <a name="citation201a"></a><a href="#footnote201a"
class="citation">[201a]</a>&nbsp; He further leaves to her, as
executrix, &ldquo;&pound;10 to be good and to my poor sister
Margarette.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his brother Simon he bequeaths
&ldquo;the best apparrell of my bodie, with riding furniture, and
my baie gelding, rapier, dagger, and pistol,&rdquo; and further
bequests.&nbsp; The testator was son of Christopher Ayscough, of
Bliborough, and married, apparently without issue, Margaret,
daughter of Symon Battell, of Denham, Suffolk.</p>
<p>Like the not very distant Wildmore Fen, in which it now has a
modern allotment of 14 acres of glebe land.&nbsp; The name of
Moorby tells of its condition at the time when it acquired that
designation, which means the &ldquo;by,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;byre,&rdquo; or farmstead on the moor. <a
name="citation201b"></a><a href="#footnote201b"
class="citation">[201b]</a>&nbsp; The moorland has now entirely
disappeared under the plough, and only young plantations
represent its former wild, woodland character.</p>
<h3>WOOD ENDERBY.</h3>
<p>Wood Enderby lies about four miles south by east from
Horncastle.&nbsp; Letters <i>via</i> Boston arrive at 10.30
a.m.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Benedict, consists of nave, north
aisle, and chancel, a low tower, with graceful broach spire,
containing one bell, and small vestry.&nbsp; It is built of a
warm-tinted green sandstone, with free stone dressings; the style
of its architecture is a combination of the early English and
Decorated periods.&nbsp; It was almost entirely rebuilt in 1860,
at a cost of about &pound;1,000.&nbsp; The south door, which is
in the tower, has an Early English arch of five mouldings.&nbsp;
There is a plain trefoiled window above in the tower; the lower
part of the spire having two lancet windows, with a circle above
them, and a small single-light window on each side, half way
up.&nbsp; In the west wall of the tower is a three-light window,
with two trefoils and a quatrefoil above.&nbsp; This is filled
with coloured glass, having the texts &ldquo;I am the way, the
truth, and the life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where two or three are
gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of
them,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No man cometh unto the Father but by
Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are similar windows, but without coloured
glass, in all four faces of the tower.&nbsp; At the north-west
angle of the tower is a staircase turret.&nbsp; Within the south
door, against the west wall, is an old stone coffin, with broken
lid, ornamented with an incised floriated cross; this was
discovered at the time of the restoration.</p>
<p>The arcade of the north aisle is of three bays, being part of
the old church, in Early English style, with plain arches,
supported on one octagonal pier and one shafted pier, with
dog-tooth ornament, the former having foliage on the
capital.&nbsp; In the north wall of the nave are three
square-headed windows of three lights, with trefoils above, the
glass being plain, except a border of red, purple, and
yellow.&nbsp; In the south wall are three two-light windows, with
trefoil and circle above; the glass being modern, with various
coloured scripture texts.</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>The sittings are of deal, with plain poppy-heads.&nbsp;
The pulpit is of modern oak, of five panels, each panel being
divided into two trefoiled arched partitions; the central panel
having a trefoil above, and below it a square piece of carved old
oak, representing Elijah blessing the cruse of oil for the widow
of Zarephath.&nbsp; The vestry, at the east end of the north
aisle, has one small trefoiled window.&nbsp; The tower and the
spire were added at the restoration.&nbsp; The chancel has a
decorated east window of three lights, with three quatrefoils
above.&nbsp; It is filled with modern coloured glass, the
subjects being, in the centre the Saviour risen from the tomb, on
the left an angel seated at the tomb, and on the right the
Magdalen.&nbsp; There is an inscription, &ldquo;Jesus saith unto
her, Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go
to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and
your Father, and to my God and your God.&nbsp; John xx,
17.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The north and south chancel walls have each one two-light
trefoiled window, with quatrefoil above; plain glass, except the
coloured band.&nbsp; In the south wall is a curious square
projecting Norman piscina, with fluted basin, and fluted
sides.&nbsp; In the north wall is an arched sepulchral
recess.&nbsp; The chancel arch is plain Early English.&nbsp; The
roof, like the sittings, is of pitch pine.&nbsp; The font has a
plain octagonal large bowl of Barnack stone, its upper rim being
modern, the shaft plain quadrilateral, with plain square columns
at the angles; base and pediment octagonal.</p>
<p>The register dates from 1561.&nbsp; It begins with the note
&ldquo;The Register booke of Woodenderbye, containing herein ye
names of all such as have been married, burried, and christened,
from Michaelmas 1561, to Michaelmas 1562.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first
five or six entries are illegible, and the others contain nothing
of special interest.&nbsp; The benefice, a vicarage, is
consolidated with the rectory of Moorby, and is now held by the
Rev. R. C. Oake.</p>
<p>As the name of Moorby indicated the character of the locality
in former times, when that name was first acquired, so Wood
Enderby means the &ldquo;bye,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;byre,&rdquo; or farmstead &ldquo;at the end of the
wood,&rdquo; as it borders on what was once the forest tract of
&ldquo;Tumby Chase&rdquo;; Haltham wood, near at hand, being a
relic of that former wild region. <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a></p>
<p>W. H. Trafford, Esq., is Lord of the Manor.&nbsp; The Hon. Mr.
Stanhope owns a large part of the land; and portions belong to
the Rev. G. Ward, and other smaller owners.&nbsp; The late Miss
Trafford Southwell founded an infant school in the village; the
older children attending the Moorby school.&nbsp; The poor
parishioners receive 6d. each at Christmas, left by an unknown
donor, out of the farm now owned by Rev. G. Ward, of Mavis
Enderby.</p>
<p>The ancient history of Wood Enderby is much the same as that
of Moorby.&nbsp; It was one of the minor demesnes, within the
Soke of Horncastle, and attached to that manor; as were also West
Ashby, High Toynton, Mareham-on-the-Hill, and other
parishes.&nbsp; It would thus also be among the estates of
Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and when his main line became
extinct, and the property was divided among collateral branches,
Wood Enderby, with Wilksby and Revesby, fell to the share of Mr.
John Carsey, or Kersey; his wife, the daughter of Sir Thomas
Lovell, Knight, being grand-daughter of Margaret, sister and
co-heir of the Duke of Suffolk.&nbsp; He owned the property <!--
page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>from 1552 to 1575, and he and his son Francis jointly
sold it to Thomas Cecil, Lord Treasurer Burleigh.&nbsp; He held
it from 1575 to 1598, when it passed in succession to the 1st and
2nd Earls of Exeter, and to Elizabeth, Lady Howard, wife of the
Earl of Berkshire, in 1640, and so in 1658 to Henry Howard; in
1663 to his cousin Craven Howard, who built the former residence
at Revesby; and, after his death, the property was sold by the
daughters of Henry Howard to the Banks family; whence the manor
has descended to the present proprietors of Revesby.</p>
<p>The manor, like that of Moorby and other parishes already
named, would at one time belong to the Bishops of Carlisle, and
they were till recently patrons of the benefice; the patronage,
within late years, being transferred to the Bishops of
Manchester, after the creation of that See in 1848.</p>
<p>At an earlier date, being an appendage to the Manor of
Horncastle, this demesne would be owned at one period by Gerard
and Ralph de Rhodes; and this is shewn by the following records
among the Final Concords, date 3rd Feb., 1224&ndash;5, whereby an
agreement was arrived at between Henry del Ortiay and Sabina his
wife, on the one part, and Ralph de Rhodes on the other part, as
to certain lands in Moorby, Enderby, Horncastle, and other
parishes, that the said Henry and Sabina should recognise the
said lands as belonging to the said Ralph; he, on his part,
granting to them other lands there, specially designated, they
rendering to him &ldquo;therefor by the year, one pair of gilt
spurs, at Easter, for all service and exaction.&rdquo; <a
name="citation203a"></a><a href="#footnote203a"
class="citation">[203a]</a>&nbsp; This agreement was settled
&ldquo;at the court of the Lord the King at Westminster on the
morrow of the purification of the blessed Mary, in the 9th year
of King Henry III. <a name="citation203b"></a><a
href="#footnote203b" class="citation">[203b]</a></p>
<p>In the old records, Testa de Nevill (circa 1326&ndash;28), it
is stated that &ldquo;the churches of Horncastre, Askeby (West
Ashby), Upper Thinton (High Toynton), of Meringes
(Mareham-on-the-Hill), and of Hinderby (Wood Enderby), are of the
gift of the lord; and Osbert, the parson, holds them of King
Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <i>Domesday Book</i> it is stated that at the time of the
Conqueror, there were &ldquo;400 acres of wood pasturage&rdquo;
in the parish, a sufficient reason for its designation.&nbsp;
Like Moorby, it was among the manors seized by the Conqueror, for
his portion of the plunder taken from our Saxon
forefathers.&nbsp; In Saxon times the Thane, Siward, had land
here; which was given by the Conqueror to his steward, Robert
Despenser, brother of the Earl Montgomery. <a

<h3>CONINGSBY.</h3>
<p>This is a large village, about 8 miles from Horncastle, in a
southerly direction.&nbsp; It is bounded on the north by
Tattershall Thorpe, on the west by Tattershall, on the south by
Wildmore, and on the east by Tumby and Mareham-le-Fen.&nbsp; Its
area is 3,442 acres, including the hamlet of Hawthorn Hill;
rateable value &pound;5,160; population 1,192.&nbsp; Apart from a
limited number of shops and three inns, the people are engaged
mainly in agriculture.&nbsp; The soil is mostly a light sand,
with a subsoil of gravel deposits and clay.&nbsp; The nearest
railway station is at Tattershall, distant about 1&frac12;
miles.</p>
<p><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>The owners of over 50 acres are Lord Willoughby de
Eresby, M.P., Lord of the Manor; Sir H. M. Hawley, Bart., J.P.;
F. Sherwin; J. Rodgers; J. Burcham Rogers, J.P.; Mrs. Evison; the
rector, Rev. Canon A. Wright, M.A., J.P., Rural Dean and Canon of
Lincoln.&nbsp; Smaller owners, about 50.&nbsp; The only
gentleman&rsquo;s seat now existing is the hall, the residence of
J. B. Rogers, Esq., J.P.</p>
<p>The old custom of ringing the pancake bell on Shrove Tuesday
is still kept up.&nbsp; The annual feast is held in the week
after St. Michael&rsquo;s Day, the patron saint.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Ignitegium,&rdquo; or curfew, was rung within the last 35
years, but has been discontinued, the parish being now lighted by
gas.</p>
<p>There are a few field names, indicating the former
&ldquo;woodland and waste&rdquo; <a name="citation204"></a><a
href="#footnote204" class="citation">[204]</a> character of the
locality.&nbsp; The Ings, or meadows, so common throughout the
district; Oatlands; Scrub Hill, scrub being an old Lincolnshire
word for a small wood; Reedham, referring to the morass;
Toothill, probably a &ldquo;look-out&rdquo; over the waste;
Langworth, probably a corruption of lang-wath, the long ford;
Troy Wood, may be British, corresponding to the Welsh caertroi, a
labyrinth or fort of mounds.&nbsp; The hamlets are Dogdyke, a
corruption of Dock-dyke (the sea having once extended to these
parts); Hawthorn Hill, Scrub Hill.&nbsp; There is an enclosure
award in the possession of the clerk of the Parish Council.</p>
<p>The parish register dates from 1561.&nbsp; The church plate is
modern, chalice and paten dated 1870; the flagon is older and
more massive, but has no date.&nbsp; The Earl of Ancaster is
patron of the benefice, a rectory, with good house, enlarged
about 30 years ago, and 500 acres of glebe.</p>
<p>The National School was built by subscription and government
grant in 1836, at a cost of about &pound;230, exclusive of the
site, which was given by the late Sir Gilbert Heathcote.&nbsp; It
was enlarged in 1875 at cost of &pound;300.&nbsp; The master has
&pound;3 per annum, left by the Rev. R. Kelham in 1719, also the
dividend of &pound;100 3&frac12; per cent. reduced consols,
bought by the bequest of the Rev. Mr. Boawre, Rector, in
1784.</p>
<p>The charities are Banks, <i>viz.</i> &pound;2 a year from land
in Haltham, for bread for the poor; Metham&rsquo;s, for poor
widows, from houses and land in Wisbech, left by Geo. Metham in
1685; Lawrence&rsquo;s, for coats for poor men, from land in
Leake, left by Robt. Lawrence in 1721.</p>
<p>The Horncastle canal traverses the parish, but is now a
derelict.</p>
<p>There was formerly a castle in this parish, the residence of a
family of the name of Coningsby, but no traces of it remain,
unless it be in an ancient dovecote, placed among some fine trees
to the east of the village.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. Michael, is a large, and
originally a fine, church, consisting of nave, with north and
south aisles, an apsidal modern chancel, and a massive western
tower.&nbsp; This latter is of Perpendicular date, very plain,
but of excellent ashlar work; it has a clock and six bells.&nbsp;
The ground stage has open arches to the north and south, with a
groined roof above, and a thoroughfare through it.&nbsp; In the
eastern wall of the south porch is a stoup, which was formerly
open, both within the porch and outside it.&nbsp; Over the porch
is a parvis or priest&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; Outside the church,
near the top of the wall of a cupola-shaped finial of the rood
loft turret is an old sun dial.&nbsp; The interior of the nave
has a massive heavy roof of beams somewhat rudely cut, with
traces of former colouring.</p>
<p>The four western bays of the arcade are Early English, with
low arches, <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the easternmost bay seems to have
been added at a later date, the arch higher and wider.&nbsp; The
moulding between two of the north arches terminates in a head, on
each side of which an evil spirit is whispering.&nbsp; Another
terminal is the head of a woman wearing the &ldquo;branks,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;scold&rsquo;s bridle.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the south side of
the chancel arch is a rood loft staircase turret, of which both
the lower and upper door remain.</p>
<p>At the restoration in 1872 the clerestory windows were spoilt
by being reduced in height; externally their original design
remains.&nbsp; In the centre of the nave are two large sepulchral
slabs, once bearing brasses, which are now gone, representing two
civilians and their wives.&nbsp; The apsidal chancel is quite out
of keeping with the rest of the fabric.&nbsp; There are some
remains of the old carved oak screen, and south of the communion
table is an Early English capital, with piscina behind it.</p>

time (circa 1630) the windows of this church abounded in coloured
glass, of which not a vestige remains.&nbsp; He gives, among the
devices, the arms of Marmyon, Dymoke, Hillary, Welles,

<p>Among the rectors of this parish have been two poets, one the
laureate of his day (1718), the Rev. Laurence Eusden, who died
1730.&nbsp; The other, John Dyer, was born 1700, appointed to the
benefice in 1752, by Sir John Heathcote, <!-- page 206--><a

author of <i>Grongar Hill</i>, <i>The Fleece</i>, and <i>The
Ruins of Rome</i>; he was honoured with a sonnet by
Wordsworth.</p>
<p>A congregation of Baptists was formed here under the
Commonwealth, with an endowment for a minister.&nbsp; The society
still exists, their present chapel being erected in 1862; they
have also a day school, built by Mr. John Overy in 1845.&nbsp;
The Wesleyans have a chapel, built in 1825, and others at
Hawthorn Hill, Haven Bank, Moorside, and Meer Booth.&nbsp; The
Primitive Methodists have a chapel, built in 1854, and others at
Reedham Corner and Scrub Hill.</p>
<p>Of the early history of this parish we have scattered notices
in various documents.&nbsp; In <i>Domesday Book</i> we find that
Sortibrand, son of Ulf the Saxon, who was one of the lagmen of
Lincoln, held a Berewick in Coningsby.&nbsp; Land here is
mentioned among the Conqueror&rsquo;s possessions.&nbsp; The
powerful favourite of the Conqueror, Robert Despenser, laid claim
to a fishery and lands in Coningsby; and the juryman of the
wapentake of Horncastle decided that his claim was good, because
Achi, his Saxon predecessor, had held the same in the time of
Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; From the same source we find that two
other powerful Normans held land here, <i>viz.</i> Hugo d&rsquo;
Abrincis, surnamed &ldquo;Lupus,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Wolf,&rdquo; from his fierce character; and Drogo de Bruere, who
had the Conqueror&rsquo;s niece to wife.</p>
<p>As with other parishes in this soke, we find from a Feet of
Fines, 9 Henry III., No. 52, that Ralph de Rhodes then held lands
here.&nbsp; Subsequently the Marmyons, Dymokes, and Taillebois,
all connected in the blazonry of the former memorial windows (as
before mentioned), held property in the parish. <a
name="citation206a"></a><a href="#footnote206a"
class="citation">[206a]</a>&nbsp; By a Chancery Inquisition post
mortem, taken 31st May, 10 Henry VII., No. 72 (A.D. 1495), it was
found that Robert Taillebois, Knt., with John Gygour, Warden of
the college of Tateshale, was seized of the manor; while,
further, in a Feet of Fines, 19 Henry VII. (1503), John Mordaunt
is acknowledged by Sir Edward Poynings, Sir Thomas Fynes, and
others, to be the owner of lands in Coningsby, and elsewhere in
the soke.&nbsp; He held at least four other manors, and lands in
many other parishes.&nbsp; Also a Feet of Fines, 21 Henry VII.
(1505), it was agreed before Humphrey Coningsby, Sergeant at Law,
Sir Giles Daubeney, and others, that the Bishop of Winchester
held certain property here.</p>
<p>The Dymokes were patrons of the benefice; Sir Charles Dymoke
presenting in 1682, after which the patronage passed to the
Heathcote family (Liber Regis and Ecton&rsquo;s Thesaurus).&nbsp;
But an earlier connection with the Dymokes is shewn by a
tombstone commemorative of &ldquo;Anna, daughter of Thomas
Dymoke, and his wife Margaret, que obijt . . .&nbsp; Ao Dni
1462.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the Humphrey Coningsby, named above, we
have already mentioned that a castellated residence in this
parish belonged to a family of that name.&nbsp; This Humphrey was
Judge of the King&rsquo;s Bench, and bought Hampton Court, co.
Hereford, of Sir Thomas Cornwall, about 1510; where was preserved
a painting of the old mansion at Coningsby. <a
name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b"
class="citation">[206b]</a>&nbsp; Thomas Coningsby was knighted
by Elizabeth in 1591.&nbsp; Sir Fitz-William Coningsby was
Sheriff of the county, 1627; and for his loyalty to Charles I.
his estates were confiscated by the Puritans.&nbsp; His son was
rewarded with a peerage by Charles II.; and saved the life of
King William at the battle of the Boyne; <!-- page 207--><a

sons dying early, and he having no further issue, the title
became extinct.</p>
<p>In the List of Gentry of Lincolnshire, made at the
Herald&rsquo;s Visitation in 1634, we find the name of Clinton
Whichcote, of Coningsby, a member of an old county family, still
occupying a good position. <a name="citation207a"></a><a
href="#footnote207a" class="citation">[207a]</a></p>
<h3>WILKSBY.</h3>
<p>Wilksby lies about halfway between the parishes of Wood
Enderby and Moorby, at a distance of about five miles from
Horncastle, in a south-easterly direction.&nbsp; Letters from
Boston <i>via</i> Revesby, arrive about 10.30 a.m.</p>
<p>The ancient history of this parish is much the same as that of
the adjoining parish of Moorby on the east, and Wood Enderby on
the west.&nbsp; It is called in <i>Domesday Book</i> Wilchesbi,
and Wilgesbi.&nbsp; At the date of that survey (1086) there were
four soc-men and five bordars, who had one carucate (or 120
acres) of land, and 20 acres of woodland; while the lord of the
manor had one carucate in demesne, and five villeins, with two
oxen in another carucate; with 20 acres of meadow and 40 acres of
underwood; so that, like the neighbouring Moor-by and Wood
Ender-by, this parish also was largely of a forest character.</p>
<p>In this parish there was also &ldquo;a Berewick of 1&frac12;
carucates&rdquo; (or 180 acres); a Berewick meaning an outlying
farm (from &ldquo;bere&rdquo; barley, and &ldquo;wick&rdquo; a
village) belonging to another manor.</p>
<p>The parish was one of the estates taken by the Conqueror for
himself, probably then forming part of the great Tumby
Chase.&nbsp; He afterwards granted the manor to his steward,
Robert Despenser, a powerful Norman noble, the ancestor of the
Earls of Gloucester, brother of the Earl Montgomery, and of Urso
de Abetot, hereditary sheriff of Worcestershire.&nbsp; He held 15
manors in Lincolnshire, and 17 in Leicestershire, beside others
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Being in the Soke of Horncastle, it would be connected with
that manor, as were so many other neighbouring parishes; and
doubtless by a similar process, to the cases of Moorby and Wood
Enderby, it belonged successively to the Brandons, Dukes of
Suffolk; the Cecils, Earls of Exeter; the Howards, Earls of
Berkshire; and finally, by purchase, passed to the Banks family,
and through them to the Stanhopes.</p>
<p>Among the Assize Rolls (No. 319, m. 9 d) is a plea, made at
Hertford, 10th May, 1247, in which &ldquo;Joan de Leweline (with
another) offered herself against Silvester, Bishop of
Karlisle,&rdquo; in a suit concerning &ldquo;&pound;20 of rent in
Enderby, Moreby, Wilkesby and Cuningby, and the advowson of the
church Moreby,&rdquo; in which the bishop failed to appear.&nbsp;
But in a Feet of Fines, Lincoln, 32 Henry III., No. 131, an
agreement was made (21st July, A.D. 1248) by which the said Joan
de Lewelyn (and others) did homage to the bishop, for these lands
in Enderby, &ldquo;Welkeby,&rdquo; &amp;c., and the advowson of
&ldquo;Moresby,&rdquo; the bishop in turn granting to them
&ldquo;the homage and whole service of Ivo, son of Odo de
Tymelby&rdquo;; and they holding the land, &amp;c., &ldquo;in
chief of the aforesaid bishop; and doing therefor the fourth part
of the service of one knight.&rdquo; <a
name="citation207b"></a><a href="#footnote207b"
class="citation">[207b]</a></p>
<p>In another document, a Final Concord, dated 27th May, 1240,
between Alan de Dauderby and Alice de Lysurs, it was agreed that
Alice should <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>&ldquo;acquit him of the service
which Robert de Theleby exacts . . . of half a knight&rsquo;s
fee, for which she is mesne.&rdquo;&nbsp; She further agrees that
Alan and his heirs shall hold certain tenements of Alice and her
heirs; to wit, 12 oxgangs and 80 acres of land, two messuages,
with a rent of 12s. 8d., and two parts of a mill in Theleby,
Wilkeby, Burton; and a meadow called Utemyng, for the service a
fourth part of a knight&rsquo;s fee; and for this Alan gave her
10 marks.</p>
<p>The former of these records shews that, like the other
parishes connected with the Manor of Horncastle, the Bishops of
Carlisle were at one period patrons of the benefice (and probably
owners of the manor) of Wilkesby; but, while in the case of
several other parishes, this patronage continues (only
transferred to the Bishops of Manchester) to the present day, the
patronage of Wilksby passed to others.&nbsp; According to Liber
Regis in 1711 and 1720 Lewis Dymoke presented to the
benefice.&nbsp; In 1764, by some arrangement, George Willows,
Gent., presented; but again, in 1833, it was in the patronage of
the Hon. the Champion, H. Dymoke, who appointed to the rectory a
relative, the Rev. J. Bradshaw Tyrwhitt, one of a very old,
knightly, Lincolnshire family, the Tyrwhitts of Stainfield,
Kettleby, &amp;c.&nbsp; A tablet to his memory is erected in the
church at Scrivelsby. <a name="citation208a"></a><a
href="#footnote208a" class="citation">[208a]</a>&nbsp; The
patronage was subsequently acquired by J. Banks Stanhope, Esq.,
and is annexed to the chaplaincy of Revesby, which has no
permanent endowment.</p>
<p>Among the List of Gentry of Lincolnshire, made at the
Herald&rsquo;s Visitation in 1634, and preserved at the
Heralds&rsquo; College, along with the Dymocks of Scrivelsby,
Haltham, Kyme and Lincoln, is Paganell Hartgrave of Wilksby. <a
name="citation208b"></a><a href="#footnote208b"
class="citation">[208b]</a></p>
<p>The church, dedicated to All Saints, is a mean structure,
erected in the 18th century, of brick and Spilsby sandstone,
standing on the site of an earlier church, of which nothing seems
to remain except the font.&nbsp; It consists of nave and chancel,
both on a very small scale, and a wooden bell-turret, with one
small bell.&nbsp; The north and west walls are of sandstone, the
former covered with a thick coating of tar to keep out the
moisture; the east wall has alternate layers of brick and
sandstone.&nbsp; Some improvements have been made in recent
years, much needed to make it even a decent place of
worship.&nbsp; The two two-light trefoiled windows in the south
wall of the nave have been framed in stone instead of wood, and
filled with green glass.&nbsp; The east window of the chancel has
wooden mullions interlaced, and it has been adorned with paper
representations of, in the centre the Ascension, to the left the
Saviour holding an infant in his arms, to the right the child
Jesus sitting among the doctors in the temple.</p>
<p>The roof of the chancel is apsidal, externally, as well as the
nave, covered with modern house tiles.&nbsp; Internally the nave
has a flat ceiling of deal boards.&nbsp; The pulpit and seats are
painted wainscot; there is a small modern oak reading desk, and a
lectern to match it.&nbsp; The chancel arch is a plain
semicircle, but on its eastern side has a pointed Early English
arch.&nbsp; The chancel rails are of modern oak, slightly carved;
and there is a deal credence table.&nbsp; The 14th century font
has a massive octagonal bowl, with large trefoils in each face,
and grotesquely carved heads at the angles; the shaft being plain
octagonal.&nbsp; The improvements were made in 1896, at the cost
of the late Mrs. Stanhope.</p>
<p><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>The register dates from 1562.&nbsp; In recent years the
incumbency of Claxby Pluckacre, where the church had gone to
ruins, has been annexed to the rectory of Wilksby, the joint
value of the two being about &pound;300 a year.&nbsp; They are
held by the Rev. P. O. Ashby, Chaplain of Revesby.</p>
<h3>LANGRIVILLE &amp; THORNTON-LE-FEN.</h3>
<p>These are modern accretions to the Soke of Horncastle, made in
the early years of the 19th century.&nbsp; They are distant
southward from Horncastle about 13 miles; situated in a tract of
land called Wildmore Fen, lying about midway between Coningsby to
the north, and Boston to the south.&nbsp; At various periods
inundated by the sea, this continued, to the end of the 18th
century, more or less a region of morass; available in the summer
for grazing, but generally during the winter under water; when
all cattle had to be removed for safety to the lands under
cultivation at the homesteads of the farmers; and if by chance
the farmer was behindhand in removing them, and the floods became
frozen, it was a common thing for his cattle, while slipping
about on the ice, to be split up, or, as it was locally termed,
&ldquo;screeved,&rdquo; and so become helpless, and fit only for
slaughter. <a name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a></p>
<p>An Act of Parliament was passed in 1787 or 1788, and
commissioners were appointed, for the drainage of this and
adjoining similar tracts; but little was done until 1800, when
the able engineer, Mr. John Rennie, submitted his plans for the
drainage to the commissioners.&nbsp; His first report, dated
April 7th, 1800, estimated the cost of draining Wildmore Fen
alone at &pound;29,702; the total outlay, for that and adjoining
fens, being put at nearly &pound;215,000.&nbsp; By 1812 these
operations were completed; and in that year an Act was passed
making these lands parochial, and assigning the two portions
above named to the Soke of Horncastle.</p>
<h3>LANGRIVILLE.</h3>
<p>Langriville, so called because it is near Langrick (or Long
Creek) on the Witham, has an area of 2,514 acres, including
Langrick Ferry; rateable value &pound;3,300.&nbsp; The population
is entirely engaged in agriculture.&nbsp; The nearest railway
station is at Langrick, in the parish.</p>
<p>It consists of the southern portion of Wildmore Fen, which at
the enclosure was allotted to the Earl of Stamford and
Warrington, in lieu of his manorial rights over Armtree and
Wildmore; with other lands sold by the Drainage Commissioners,
early in the 19th century.&nbsp; The Earl&rsquo;s estates
afterwards passed, by purchase, to the late J. Fretwell Bramley
and others.&nbsp; The present Lord of the Manor is Lord Malcolm,
of Poltallock; and he, the Rector of Coningsby, the executors of
Lady Ingram Watkin, J. Linton, Esq., of Stirtcoe, Buckden,
Herts., Harrison Hayter, Esq., W. Goodenough Hayter, Esq., Mr.
Jonathan Fox, of Boston, E. Harrison, Esq., and Mr. William
Pepper are the largest land owners.</p>
<p>A small brick church was erected in 1831, consisting of nave,
chancel and <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>bell turret; and repaired and
improved in 1885, by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.&nbsp; The
Bishop of Lincoln is patron; and the Rev. W. Fitz-Harry Curtis is
the incumbent, who has here a residence, with an income of
&pound;320 a year.</p>
<p>The Wesleyans have a chapel at Langrick Ferry, also in Armtree
Road.&nbsp; By an order in council, dated 26th August, 1881,
Langriville and Thornton-le-Fen were united, under the title of
&ldquo;The Consolidated Chapelry of Wildmore.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is a church at each place.&nbsp; At the time of the enclosure fen
allotments were assigned to various of the older parishes, and
these are many of them now included in this modern district,
comprising parts of Fishtoft Fen, of Coningsby, of Kirkstead,
Scrivelsby, Woodhall, Dalderby, and Martin.&nbsp; The entire area
is now 10,500 acres, and population 1,470.</p>
<p>The National School, erected in 1857, is at Gipsy Bridge, now
under a School Board.</p>
<h3>THORNTON-LE-FEN.</h3>
<p>Thornton-le-Fen adjoins Langriville, lying to the east of it,
about three miles from Langrick railway station.&nbsp; The area
was originally about 1,425 acres, including Bunkers Hill, part of
Gipsy Bridge, and other scattered farms, which were sold by the
Drainage Commissioners early in the 19th century, when it was
made, by Act of Parliament, a parochial township.&nbsp; Rateable
value &pound;1,979.&nbsp; It has its name from the former chief
proprietors, the Thornton family; but the chief land owners now
are Lord Malcolm of Poltalloch, the Pepper, Ireland, Creasey,
Ward, and Wilcock families.&nbsp; The soil is clay, and very
fertile.</p>
<p>The church, which was built on the Fen Chapel Estates in 1816,
is a small brick building, containing 200 sittings; the benefice,
valued at &pound;100 a year, is in the gift of the Bishop of
Lincoln, and by order in council, dated 26th August, 1881, was
consolidated with the chapelry of Langriville; the two being of
the united yearly value of &pound;320, and held by the Rev. W.
Fitz-Harry Curtis, who resides at the latter place.</p>
<p>A good school and master&rsquo;s house were erected in 1880,
by the School Board of Wildmore Fen, at a cost of about
&pound;1,200, to accommodate 168 children.&nbsp; The Wesleyans
have a chapel at New York and Bunkers&rsquo; Hill.&nbsp; The
Primitive Methodists have also a chapel.</p>
<p>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners, to whom the Fen Chapel
Estates were transferred in 1876, pay &pound;120 a year for a
curate, who now is the Rev. Harold E. Curtis.&nbsp; The total
area is now 10,500 acres, and population 1,470.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;Other parishes have
once been in the Soke of Horncastle, which no longer belong to
it.&nbsp; <i>Domesday Book</i> gives Scrivelsby, &ldquo;Langton
and (its) Thorpe&rdquo; (from which I write; &ldquo;Thorpe&rdquo;
being doubtless the outlying district recently known as Langton
St. Andrew), and also Edlington.&nbsp; How these became separated
is not known.&nbsp; As suggested by the author of
<i>Scrivelsby</i>, <i>the home of the Champions</i>, Scrivelsby,
as a barony of the Marmyon and Dymoke families, would probably be
separated by payment of a fine; such powerful families preferring
not to be sub-ordinated to another manor.&nbsp; Several Dymokes,
however, were buried at Horncastle, where are their
monuments.</p>

forests, even in later times, may be formed from the account
given by De la Prime (<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, No. 75,
p. 980) who says &ldquo;round about the skirts of the wolds are
found infinite millions of the roots and bodies of trees of great
size.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pliney tells us that the Britons had
&ldquo;powerful mastiffs&rdquo; for hunting the wild boar, and
Manwood in an old <i>Treatise on Forest Laws</i> (circa 1680)
states (p. 60) that the finest mastiffs were bred in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Fuller, in his <i>Worthies of England</i> (p.
150) mentions that a Dutchman (circa 1660) coming to England for
sport, spent a whole season in pursuit of wild game &ldquo;in
Lincolniensi montium tractu,&rdquo; by which doubtless were
intended the wolds.&nbsp; A writer in the <i>Arch&aelig;ological
Journal</i> (June, 1846) says &ldquo;the whole country of the
Coritani (<i>i.e.</i> Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, &amp;c.) was
then, and long after, a dense forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name
&ldquo;Coritani,&rdquo; or more properly Coitani, is the Roman
adaptation of the British &ldquo;Coed,&rdquo; a wood, which still
survives in Wales in such place-names as &ldquo;Coed Coch,&rdquo;
the red wood, &ldquo;Bettws y Coed,&rdquo; the chapel in the
wood, &amp;c.&nbsp; This was their distinguishing characteristic
to the Roman, they were wood-men.</p>

the Britons C&aelig;sar bears testimony.&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;They drive their chariots in all directions, throwing
their spears, and by the fear of their horses and the noise of
their wheels they disturb the ranks of their enemies; when they
have forced their way among the troops they leap down and fight
on foot.&nbsp; By constant practice they acquire such skill that
they can stop, turn, and guide their horses when at full speed
and in the most difficult ground.&nbsp; They can run along the
chariot pole, sit on the collar and return with rapidity into the
chariot, by which novel mode (he says) his men were much
disturbed.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Novitate pugn&aelig;

not known (that term merely meaning a native of Ravenna), was an
anonymous geographer, who wrote a <i>Chorography of Britian</i>,
as well as of several other countries, about A.D. 650.&nbsp;
These were confessedly compilations from older authorities, and
were, two centuries later, revised by Guido of Ravenna, and
doubtless by others at a later period still, since the work, in
its existent form describes the Saxons and Danes, as well, in
Britain.&nbsp; As Gallio, also of Ravenna, was the last Roman
general in command in these parts, it has been suggested that he
was virtually the original author (Horsley&rsquo;s
<i>Britannia</i>, 1732, chap. iv., p. 489; also <i>The Dawn of

of Custance, wife of Ralph Fitz Gilbert; the latter held the

to have been of a particularly hot temperament.&nbsp; I have
mentioned in another volume (<i>Records of Woodhall Spa</i>, pp.
14.0, &amp;c.) several of his actions of gross violence against
the Saviles of Poolham Hall, in this neighbourhood, about the
same date (1578).&nbsp; I will merely state here that he, with a
party of followers, attacked Sir Robert Savile, when on a hunting
excursion, seized several of his hounds and hanged them, as Sir
Robert says, &ldquo;upon my own tree within my own
ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; He forced his way into the parlour at
Poolham and challenged Sir Robert to fight &ldquo;six to
six&rdquo; of their dependents.&nbsp; After an entertainment at
Horncastle his followers, at his instigation, got hold of an
unfortunate tailor, &ldquo;drew their swords and sore wounded
him,&rdquo; saying he should &ldquo;have that and more, for his
master&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Sir Robert Savile&rsquo;s son.&nbsp;
One Robert Fullshaw, of Waddingworth, prayed the justices for
protection against his &ldquo;horrible outrages,&rdquo; and it
was said that his conduct &ldquo;savoured of

shewn by the following documents:&mdash;In the archives of
Carlisle Cathedral is a copy, in Latin, of a Privy Seal State
Paper, Domestic, vol. i, 5039, of date 5 May, 6 Henry VIII. (A.D.
1514), slightly imperfect, but running thus: &ldquo;The King to
all . . . greeting.&nbsp; Know that we, of our special grace . .
. by these presents do grant . . . for us, our heirs and
successors . . . to the devout woman, the Lady Margaret
Copuldyke, widow, and Richard Clarke, tanner, of Horncastle, that
they found a fraternity, or guild, to the honour of St.
Katharine, and for the extending of divine teaching, in the
Parish Church of the blessed Virgin of Horncastell, and mortain
licence to acquire land of the annual value of 25 marks&rdquo;
(&pound;16 15s. 4d.).&nbsp; Another document, a Chantry
Certificate, Lincoln, No. 33 (55), Ed. VI. (1552), states that
&ldquo;the Guild of St. Katharine, in Horncastell, was founded by
<i>Joan</i> Copuldyke, widow, and others, with the intention that
one Chaplain for ever, should celebrate divine services in the
church, for the souls of the founder, and others; the profits of
the land and possessions are received by the Alderman of the
Guild.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are described as &ldquo;worth yearly
&pound;13 8s. 8d., with fees, wages, rents and other reprises,
&pound;7 15s. 3d.&nbsp; The clear value, reprises deducted,
yearly, &pound;5 13s. 10d.,&rdquo; with &ldquo;goods, chattels
and ornaments worth &pound;1 10s.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to be
observed that Gervase Holles says, that at the time of his visit,
she was named &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; in a window then existing
in the church.&nbsp; A Patent Roll, 3 Ed. VI., pt. 5, m. 4, gives
various lands and tenements, with which this chantry was endowed,
in Horncastle, Spilsby, Thornton and Roughton, occupied by about
100 tenants; and states that all these were granted &ldquo;by the
King to Robert Carr, gent., of Sleaford, and John Almond, their
heirs and assigns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Witness, the King, at
Westminster, 15 July, 1549.&nbsp; This is further confirmed by an

class="footnote">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Walker in his <i>Sufferings of
the Clergy</i> (1714) gives an account of Thomas Gibson, which we
here abridge.&nbsp; Born at Keswick (in the diocese of Carlisle),
he went to Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, was appointed Master of
the Free School at Carlisle, there promoted to the similar post
at Newcastle, and finally preferred by the Bishop of Carlisle to
the Vicarage of Horncastle in 1634.&nbsp; In consequence of a
sermon preached by him, at the Election for Convocation, he was
seized, in 1643, and carried as a prisoner to Hull.&nbsp; Being
released after four month&rsquo;s detention, and returning to
Horncastle, he was charged with teaching &ldquo;ormanism&rdquo;
(arminianism), and committed to the &ldquo;County Jail&rdquo; at
Lincoln, a Presbyterian minister being appointed in his stead at
Horncastle.&nbsp; In 1644 Colonel King, the Governor of Boston
under the Parliament, ordered a party of horse to seize him
(apparently having been released from Lincoln) and to plunder his
house, but an old pupil, Lieut. Col. John Lillburn, interceded
for him with his superior officer, Col. King, and the order was
revoked.&nbsp; In the subsequent absence, however, of Lillburn in
London, the order was repeated, and Mr. Gibson was made prisoner,
his house plundered, and his saddle horse, draught horses, and
oxen carried off.&nbsp; He was imprisoned at Boston, Lincoln and
&ldquo;Tattors-Hall Castle,&rdquo; where he had &ldquo;very
ill-usage for 17 weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sequestrated from his
benefice and an &ldquo;intruder,&rdquo; named Obadiah How, put in
charge.&nbsp; He was now accused of defending episcopacy,
&ldquo;refusing the covenant,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; He retired to
a &ldquo;mean house,&rdquo; about a mile from Horncastle,
supposed to be at &ldquo;Nether (Low) Toynton,&rdquo; where he
and his family &ldquo;lived but poorly for two years, teaching a
few pupils.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was then appointed Master of the Free
School at Newark, two years later removed to the school at
Sleaford, being presented by Lady Carr.&nbsp; There he lived
until the Restoration, and then resumed his Vicarage at
Horncastle, until he died in 1678, aged 84.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a
grave and venerable person (says Walker), of a sober and regular
conversation, and so studious of peace, that when any differences
arose in his parish, he never rested till he had composed
them.&nbsp; He had likewise so well principled his parish that,
of 250 families in it, he left but one of them Dissenters at his
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Walker&rsquo;s <i>Sufferings of the
Clergy</i>, pt. ii, p. 252, Ed. 1714).</p>
<p><a name="footnote40b"></a><a href="#citation40b"
class="footnote">[40b]</a>&nbsp; There is an error in the date,
which should be Oct. 11.&nbsp; Further, the term &ldquo;arch
rebel&rdquo; is inappropriate, as Cromwell was, at that time,
only a Colonel, far from having attained his later distinction;
the term &ldquo;skirmish&rdquo; is also inadequate, as the
Winceby battle was a decisive engagement, with important
consequences.</p>
<p><a name="footnote41a"></a><a href="#citation41a"
class="footnote">[41a]</a>&nbsp; The origin of these scythes has
of late years been a <i>vexata questio</i>.&nbsp; It has been
suggested that they are not, as generally supposed, relics of the
Parliamentary War, but of the earlier so-called &ldquo;Pilgrimage
of Grace,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lincolnshire Rising,&rdquo; a movement
intended as a protest against certain abuses attending the
Reformation, in the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp; The evidence,
however, gathered from various directions, would seem to be
strongly corroborative of the old and more general opinion.&nbsp;
History shows that, for many years, about the period of the
Commonwealth, scythes were among the commonest, rude weapons of
war.&nbsp; The artist Edgar Bundy, in his painting &ldquo;The
morning of Edgemoor,&rdquo; recently (1905) purchased for the
National Gallery by the Chantry Trustees, represents a soldier
armed with a straight wooden-handled scythe.&nbsp; The battle of
Edgemoor was fought Oct. 23, 1642, one year before that of
Winceby.&nbsp; We have also contemporary testimony in the
<i>Memoirs of the Verney Family</i> (vol. i, pp. 109&ndash;118
and 315), members of which took part in the civil war of that
period, that King Charles&rsquo; forces consisted largely of
untrained peasants, &ldquo;ill-fed and clothed . . . having
neither colours, nor halberts . . . many only rude pikes . . .
few a musket.&rdquo;&nbsp; To such the scythes used in their farm
labour would be handy weapons in emergency.&nbsp; As a parallel
to these cases Sir Walter Scott, in his preface to <i>Rob
Roy</i>, states that &ldquo;many of the followers of MacGregor,
at the battle of Prestonpans (Sep. 21, 1745), were armed with
scythe blades, set straight upon their handles, for want of guns
and swords.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not without interest to note, that
about 60 years ago there were exhumed, on the farm above Langton
Hill, in Horncastle, the remains of 6 bodies, lying buried in a
row, with scythe blades beside them.&nbsp; It is known that
skirmishes between Royalists and Roundheads took place in this
locality, and it can hardly be doubted that these also were
relics of the Winceby fight.&nbsp; The then tenant of the farm,
Mr. Dobson (as the writer has been informed by his granddaughter,
Mrs. H. Boulton of St. Mary&rsquo;s Square, Horncastle), carted
these remains to the town and they were re-buried in the south
side of St. Mary&rsquo;s Churchyard, while the scythes were added
to those already in the church.&nbsp; An incident, which further
confirms their connection with the Winceby fight, is that the
present writer has in his possession a pair of spurs, which were
found on the field of Winceby, remarkable for the long spikes of
their rowels; and he himself once found the rowel of a spur, with
similarly long spikes, within a few yards of where the bodies
were discovered; and in the year 1905 he also examined several
bones, pronounced by a doctor to be human, which were found near
the same spot, while workmen were digging for the foundations of
a house since erected there.&nbsp; On the other hand, as against
the theory of the scythes having been used in the earlier
&ldquo;Pilgrimage of Grace,&rdquo; we are distinctly told that
the mobs concerned in that movement were deprived of all weapons
before they could use them.&nbsp; In the Lincoln Chapter House
books (c. i, 20, f 193) is a letter from Richard Cromwell, dated
Oct. 29, 1586, which says that he, and Admiral Sir John Russell,
went to Louth, where &ldquo;all the harness and weapons were
seized, and conveyed to Lincoln,&rdquo; and that for the same
purpose Mr. Bryan had been sent to Horncastle, and Mr. Brown to
Market Rasen.&nbsp; On the whole, therefore, the preponderance of
evidence is strongly in favour of the connection of all these
scythes with the neighbouring Battle of Winceby&mdash;the
original tradition.</p>

returning to Horncastle in time for the daily service at 11

following: At Horncastle a poor girl was suffering from a
&ldquo;white swelling&rdquo; in the knee.&nbsp; The doctor
declared that her life could only be saved by the leg being
amputated above the knee.&nbsp; She dreaded the operation, but
consented, if Mr. White would support her in his arms during the
process.&nbsp; He was greatly averse to painful scenes, but
reluctantly consented.&nbsp; Those were not the days of
an&aelig;sthetics, when such operations can be performed without
the patients feeling it; but he said to her &ldquo;Let us
pray,&rdquo; and while the doctors were at work they prayed so
fervently that she was too much absorbed to notice what was
done.&nbsp; At length she said, &ldquo;Dear Mr. White will they
never begin?&rdquo;&nbsp; His reply was &ldquo;My good girl, your
leg is off, and the Lord has spared you all the
pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; She lived to be a strong healthy woman and
always blessed the curate.</p>

town in Normandy, now called Aumale, whence the Duc d&rsquo;
Aumale, of the Royal family of France, takes his title.&nbsp;
Probably the Earl put in a claim for this demesne indirectly,
because (as already stated) Adeliza, Countess of Albemarle, was
sister of Bishop Odo, the former Lord of Thimbleby.</p>

who would appear to have been a zealous iconoclast.&nbsp;
According to one tradition they went to Billinghay, but as the
church there has only three bells, this is probably an
error.&nbsp; Another version is that they were transferred to
Tetford church; had the removal occurred in the time of the
Thimblebys, this might not have been improbable, as they were
patrons of that benefice; but several other churches claim this
distinction, and, further, there are only three bells in that
church, so that this again is doubtless a mistake.</p>

held their lands under the lord, on the terms of doing certain
agricultural service for him.&nbsp; Bordars, from the Saxon
&ldquo;bord&rdquo; a cottage, were a lower class of smaller
tenants, who had a cottage and small allotment, supplying to the
lord more continuous labour, and also eggs and poultry.&nbsp; By
statute of Queen Elizabeth (31 Eliz., c. 7), which probably only
confirmed old usage, at that time liable to fall into abeyance,
it was enacted that any proprietor electing a new cottage should
be compelled to attach thereto four acres of land.&nbsp; If
something like this were done in these days we should probably
hear less of the rural population migrating to the towns, to the
increase of pauperage.&nbsp; There was a third still lower class
of dependents, not here mentioned, named villeins, who performed
the meanest labours; these were attached either to the land, or
to the person of the owner, and could be transferred from one to
another owner, like goods or chattels.&nbsp; Such a position of
serfdom is unknown to the agricultural labourer of modern times;
and their name, as having belonged to the lowest grade of
society, now only survives as a synonym for a dishonest person, a
scoundrel or villain.</p>

perhaps owing to laxity of morals, but partly because the papal
supremacy was not fully recognised, celibacy of the clergy was
not strictly enforced.&nbsp; On the accession of Queen Mary great
numbers of them were found to be married.&nbsp; She issued
&ldquo;Injunctions&rdquo; to the bishops in 1553&ndash;4,
ordering them to deprive all such of their benefices; although
some of them, on doing public penance, were restored to their
position.&nbsp; In the Lincoln Lists of Institutions to
Benefices, at that period, many of the vacancies are stated to
have occurred, owing to the deprivation of the previous
incumbent; and in some cases, as at Knebworth, Herts., and at
Haversham, Bucks, (both then in the Lincoln diocese), it is
specified that the incumbent so deprived was married (sacerdos

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
